But that principle gained \nnew traction in the latter half of 2019, when the Business \nRoundtable gave fresh voice to it. The new statement of \ncorporate purpose said simply that companies should take \nthe interests of all stakeholders \u2014 including sharehold-\ners, colleagues, clients, suppliers and communities \u2014 into \naccount when making decisions. Who could have imagined \njust how urgent responsible companies\u2019 commitment to \nserve the greater good would be, less than a year later? \n\nAs I write this letter, we are in the midst \nof the COVID-19 pandemic, which will have \na wide-ranging and long-lasting impact \non every part of the world. Our global \nsociety and economy are being tested \nto an unprecedented degree. Managing \nthrough this crisis will require the best of \nwhat we, as a company and as a society, \nhave to offer. I know that the progress we \nhave made in the past has meaningfully \ncontributed to our ability to weather the \npresent storm and, ultimately, to recover \nfrom it.\n\nWe know that this crisis is having a dispro-\nportionate impact on our most vulnerable \ncommunities. To help mitigate widespread \neconomic distress, our society needs \nto find better ways to address wealth \ninequality and provide more people with \naffordable access to financial products \nand services. Programs like Cobro Digital \n(CoDi), launched in Mexico last year, \nhave become increasingly relevant as a \n\n5\n\n\f##PAGE_BREAK##Contents \n\n  Our Approach to ESG\u2003\n\n  Solutions for Impact \n\n  How We Do Business \n\n  Appendices      \u2003\u2003\u2003\u2003\u2003\u2003 \n\nLetter from Our CEO (continued)\n\nmeans of bridging the gap between the \ndigital haves and have-nots. Today, CoDi \nis enabling more than 5.5 million digital \nclients to send invoices and payments \nusing QR codes on their phones at no \ncost. Citibanamex is one of the leading \nbanks behind this innovative initiative \nand has had a leadership role since its \ninception.\n\nWe\u2019re also continuing to support entre-\npreneurs through efforts like Scaling \nEnterprise, a $100 million loan guarantee \nfacility and joint effort with the U.S. \nInternational Development Finance \nCorporation (the former OPIC) and the \nFord Foundation. Scaling Enterprise \nprovides early-stage financing in local \ncurrency to companies that expand \naccess to products and services for \nlow-income communities in emerging \nmarkets. To complement our lending \nactivities, our new $150 million Citi \nImpact Fund will make equity invest-\nments in socially oriented startups  \nand companies.\n\nAnd we continue to champion philan-\nthropic causes to increase economic \nopportunity. An urgent need is to help \nnarrow the gap between the skills and \nknowledge many young people have and \nwhat they will need in order to succeed \nin this century. That\u2019s why one of our \nlargest philanthropic focus areas is work-\nforce development. Last year, the Citi \nFoundation completed its three-year,  \n$100 million Pathways to Progress \ninitiative to invest in preparing youth for \n21st century jobs, and we\u2019ll soon expand \nthat program with an additional new \ncommitment. Last year, Citi and the Citi \nFoundation gave $147 million in grants \nand charitable contributions.\n\nI know that these efforts will continue and \nwill even accelerate as will the time and \ndedication that my Citi colleagues pledge \nto supporting their communities. We have \ncommitted to build on the nearly 1 million \nhours of service contributed by Citi volun-\nteers in 2019, virtually and once we can \nsafely re-engage with our communities.\n\nWe also strongly believe that our most \nimportant impact comes from our core \nbusiness activities, including the financ-\ning of critical infrastructure, affordable \nhousing, environmental finance and small \nbusiness lending. The economic recovery \nwill be further strengthened by institu-\ntions\u2019 commitments to addressing an \nincreasingly acute shortage of affordable \nhousing. Last year, Citi provided more \nthan $6 billion in loans for affordable \nhousing projects in the U.S., making our \nfirm the largest U.S. affordable housing \nlender for the 10th consecutive year. \n\nIt\u2019s also my hope that one outcome of \nour present predicament will be an even \ndeeper respect for science and a recogni-\ntion of the investments in technology we \nwill need to make to help our world thrive \nin the years ahead. Innovation will be \nessential as we look to confront the many \nother challenges that critically impact us \nall \u2014 chief among them, climate change. \n\nOur health, our economic success and \nour environment are all inextricably \nlinked, which is why, despite the current \nchallenges, we must sustain our efforts \nto fight climate change. In 2019, Citi \nexceeded our $100 billion goal to help \nreduce the impacts of climate change \nthrough environmental finance activities \naround the world more than four years \nahead of schedule. Still, we know much \n\nremains to be done, quickly, and so we \nare as committed as ever to bringing our \nresources and capacity for innovation to \nbear as we seize the opportunity to even \nmore effectively and creatively tackle this \nurgent challenge.     \n\nBanks have a central role to play, both in \nhelping people and communities through \nthe current pandemic and in the ultimate \nrecovery. At Citi, we will continue working \nwith all of our clients and customers \u2014 \nindividuals, small businesses, companies \nand governments around the world \u2014 to \nmanage the business and economic \nfallout of this pandemic. We will provide \nthe necessary support, credit and assis-\ntance programs that people, institutions \nand communities will need to rebuild.\n\nI write this letter with the utmost humility, \nas I know the work ahead will require \neven more focus, more dedication, more \npartnership and more commitment than \nat any time in recent memory. But we will \nuse the lessons of the past and the depth \nof our partnerships to guide us. I have \nevery confidence that, as a company and a \nsociety, we will emerge stronger and more \ncommitted to the collective good than ever \nbefore. I know our citizens, our companies \nand our governments are resolved to do \nnothing less. My colleagues at Citi and I are \nmore than ready to help lead the way.  \n\nMichael L.

Our core activities are \nsafeguarding assets, lending money, making payments and accessing the capital markets \non behalf of our clients. We have 200 years of experience helping our clients meet the \nworld\u2019s toughest challenges and embrace its greatest opportunities. We are Citi, the \nglobal bank \u2014 an institution connecting millions of people across hundreds of countries \nand cities. \n\nWe protect people\u2019s savings and help \nthem make the purchases \u2014 from every-\nday transactions to buying a home \u2014 that \nimprove the quality of their lives. We \nadvise people on how to invest for future \nneeds, such as their children\u2019s education \nand their own retirement, and help them \nbuy securities such as stocks and bonds. \n\nWe work with companies to optimize \ntheir daily operations, whether they need \nworking capital, to make payroll or to \nexport their goods overseas. By lending to \ncompanies large and small, we help them \n\ngrow, creating jobs and real economic \nvalue at home and in communities around \nthe world. We provide financing and \nsupport to governments at all levels, so \nthey can build sustainable infrastructure, \nsuch as housing, transportation, schools \nand other vital public works. \n\nThese capabilities create an obligation to \nact responsibly, do everything possible to \ncreate the best outcomes, and prudently \nmanage risk. If we fall short, we will \ntake decisive action and learn from our \nexperience. \n\nWe strive to earn and maintain the \npublic\u2019s trust by constantly adhering to \nthe highest ethical standards. We ask our \ncolleagues to ensure that their decisions \npass three tests: they are in our clients\u2019 \ninterests, create economic value, and are \nalways systemically responsible. When we \ndo these things well, we make a positive \nfinancial and social impact in the commu-\nnities we serve and show what a global \nbank can do. \n\nSustainable design is present throughout the renovation of our global headquarters in New York City, which will be completed in 2020. The building was recently \nawarded LEED Platinum certification.\n\n8\n\nCiti 2019 ESG Report\f##PAGE_BREAK##Our Approach to Creating \nPositive Impact\n\nThrough our business, we address some of society\u2019s greatest challenges \u2014 an imperative \nstated in our mission and an idea that shapes our decisions every day. In this report, we \nshare many individual stories of progress \u2014 how as a bank, employer and philanthropist, \nCiti catalyzes sustainable growth, helping to drive broader systemic improvements. We \nalso outline the ideas and frameworks, both internal and external, that guide us in this \nwork, ensuring that we tackle challenges and engage with our communities in a way that \nis consistent with our mission and values and in alignment with global and industry  \nefforts, including the UN Sustainable Development Goals, the Principles for Responsible \nBanking and the Paris Climate Agreement.\n\nWhile our commitment to engagement, \ninnovation and market-based solutions \nis unwavering, we recognize that many \nof the biggest societal challenges are \npart of a significant economic and social \ntransition that will take years \u2014 in some \ncases generations \u2014 to come to fruition. \nWe continue to learn from our experience  \nand to bring diverse stakeholders to the \ntable to help us understand what leader-\nship looks like on these evolving issues. \nThroughout the following pages, we \noutline how we put our guiding principles \ninto action. \n\nOur Guiding Principles\n\nWe are guided by a commitment to drive \npositive social and environmental impact \nthrough our products and services and \nour work with clients. Success \u2014 for us \nand for the financial services sector as a \nwhole \u2014 requires that we operate respon-\nsibly, building ethical decision-making \ninto everything we do. When we do \nthis well, we have the latitude to drive \nsolutions through other avenues as well, \nusing our corporate voice to engage in \ndialogue around the most pressing issues \nand reporting transparently about our \n\nown progress. We also use philanthropy \nand the time and talent of our employees \nto catalyze innovations for customers and \ncommunities in a way that can be brought \nto scale.\n\nExecuting a Business \nModel that Adds \nValue to Society\n\nThe scale and global reach of our \nbusiness means we are able to have \nsignificant impact through the products \nand services we bring to market. Our \n\n9\n\n\f##PAGE_BREAK##Contents \n\n  Our Approach to ESG\u2003\n\n  Solutions for Impact \n\n  How We Do Business \n\n  Appendices      \u2003\u2003\u2003\u2003\u2003\u2003 \n\nbusiness activities demand financial \ninnovations that meet the needs of our \nclients and tackle some of society\u2019s \ngreatest challenges \u2014 a concept that is \nfundamental to our mission to enable \ngrowth and progress. Aligning with \nthis mission requires that we not only \npursue the opportunities presented \nbut also that we understand the risks \ninherent in our financing decisions and \nour own operations. This dichotomy \nis best evidenced in our efforts to \nfinance a sustainable economy while \nunderstanding and mitigating our \nenvironmental and social risk. We know \nwe have a great deal more work to do \nin these and other efforts, as noted \nthroughout this report in discussions of \nthe management of our material ESG \nissues. \n\nMaintaining a Focus \non Ethical Decision- \nMaking & Responsible  \nBusiness Practices\n\nEthical business practices are central \nto the success of the entire financial \nservices sector and are the foundation \nof all our activities at Citi. We place \nsignificant emphasis on understanding, \nimproving and fully integrating ethical \nand responsible practices into every-\nthing we do. \n\nThe Ethics and Culture section \nprovides more detail on how we do \n\nthis \u2014 both our successes and where we \nsee need for continued attention and \nimprovement. \n\n!\n?\n\nTaking a Stand on \nIssues that Matter \nand Driving Solutions\n\nCompanies are increasingly expected \nto leverage their corporate voices to \nbenefit society. Like many of our corpo-\nrate peers, we have chosen to take a \nstand on a wide range of issues, includ-\ning climate change, pay equity, immi-\ngration, racial equity and gun violence \nin the U.S. We have made statements \nin response to issues that matter to \nour employees, clients, investors and \ncommunities. Speaking out, however, is \noften just the first step. Where we can, \nwe work to be part of the solutions to \nthese very complex and pressing issues. \n\nReporting  \nTransparently and \nLearning Through \nDialogue \n\nTo successfully meet the expectations \nof our stakeholders, especially as the \nscope and pace of disclosure evolves, \nwe need to both communicate what \nwe are doing and engage in dialogue \nto understand what more can be done. \nWe are committed to improving our \nreporting efforts and the way in which \n\nRecognition of Our Efforts\n\nIn 2020, Citi placed seventh overall out of 300 firms \u2014 and first in the finan-\ncial category \u2014 in Newsweek\u2019s inaugural index of America\u2019s Most Responsible \nCompanies, a ranking of the country\u2019s top-performing companies in the \ncontext of corporate social responsibility. The rankings were based on an \nindependent survey of 6,500 U.S. citizens and an analysis of performance \nindicators included in external reporting.  \n\nwe engage stakeholders. For example, \nwe have deepened our reporting on \nclimate-related risks and opportunities \nas part of our responses to the Task \nForce on Climate-related Financial \nDisclosures, including more information \nin this report as well as additional, \nstand-alone climate-related reporting.\n\nCatalyzing Innovation \nThrough Strategic  \nPhilanthropy \nand Employee \nEngagement \n\nCiti and the Citi Foundation support a \nvariety of philanthropic causes and, \nwherever possible, develop partnerships \nwith community organizations that \nallow us to catalyze change through \ninnovative and efficient solutions. In \n2019, the Citi Foundation provided  \n$76 million in grants that increase  \nfinancial capability, promote job \nopportunities for youth and reimagine \napproaches to building economically \nvibrant communities. In addition, \nthrough Citi businesses around the \nworld, Citi provided $70 million in \ncharitable giving to causes that align \nwith our mission of enabling growth and \nprogress. \n\nWe increase our positive impact in \nthe community by encouraging our \ncolleagues to lend their time and \ntalent toward volunteer activities that \ncomplement our philanthropic giving. \nOur signature effort, Global Community \nDay, engaged more than 120,000 volun-\nteers in 2019, including Citi colleagues, \nalumni, clients, friends and families \nin more than 400 cities across 90 \ncountries. \n\nWe highlight examples of Citi and Citi \nFoundation philanthropy in the Inclusive \nand Resilient Communities section and \nprovide more detail on how we engage \nour employees in volunteer activities in \nthe Talent and Diversity section. \n\n10\n\nCiti 2019 ESG Report\f##PAGE_BREAK##Reporting on Climate Change \n\nThe risks and opportunities connected to climate change affect many parts of our business. As such, there are \nmultiple points of reference \u2014 on our approach, results and challenges \u2014 throughout this report. For example:\n\nClimate opportunities, and the \nrole Citi plays in financing a low-\ncarbon, climate-resilient future, \nare explored in more detail in the \nEnvironmental Finance section.\n\nClimate risk in transactions and \n\nclients \u2014 a critical topic as it relates \nto our core business \u2014 is considered \n\nthrough our ESRM Policy and \n\nbroader climate risk analysis, as \n\ndetailed in the ESRM section. \n\nOur operational impacts on \nthe climate, from our direct \n\noperations to our supply chain, \nare explored in the Operations \n\nand Supply Chain section.\n\nThe TCFD index highlights where climate-related content in response to the TCFD\u2019s recommendations can be \nfound in this report. \n\nCiti\u2019s Support for \nClimate Action\n\nOver the last few years, numerous \nclimate reports, including those from \nthe Intergovernmental Panel on Climate \nChange (IPCC), as well as the Fourth \nNational Climate Assessment from the \nU.S. Global Change Research Program, \nmake clear that the world is rapidly \nwarming, leading to changes in weather \npatterns, sea levels and terrestrial and \nocean ecosystems. The impacts and costs \nof climate change are already affecting \nmany industries and regions globally and \nare expected to further increase as the \nworld continues to warm. \n\nThe science on climate is clear, and \nthe expectations of corporate and \ngovernment action are only increasing. \nFrom youth-led climate marches and \nschool strikes to investor proposals for \nclimate-related disclosures, the pressure \nis mounting for companies like Citi to \ncontribute to solutions.\n\nTackling climate change requires a global \nenergy transition, as well as sustainable \nurban and regional development. As a \nglobal bank, we have a meaningful role\n\nto play and are responding in several \nways: through increased climate- \nrelated measurement and disclosure, \nenhanced Environmental and Social Risk \nManagement (ESRM) policies and reduc-\ntions in our own environmental footprint. \nWe also are stress-testing our business \nand innovating our products  \nand services accordingly. \n\nWe demonstrate leadership by collabo-\nrating with other companies and orga-\nnizations to drive change. In 2019, for \nexample, we worked with other banks and \norganizations within the shipping indus-\ntry to develop and cosign the Poseidon \nPrinciples, a framework for lenders, \nlessors and financial guarantors to inte-\ngrate climate considerations into lending \ndecisions with international shipping \nclients. Learn more in the ESRM section.\n\nWe also publish thought leadership \ncontent to stimulate dialogue and action. \nFor example, the Citi Global Perspectives \n& Solutions (Citi GPS) report Energy \nDarwinism III: The Electrifying Path to Net \nZero Carbon offers data and narrative \nregarding the transition toward renew-\nable energy and away from fossil-based \nenergy sources and technologies such as \ncoal and combustion engines. The report \n\nhighlights some of the opportunities that \narise from this transition and the risks of \ncontinued investment in the incumbent \nenergy infrastructure.\n\n2\u00b0 Investing Initiative \nScenario Analysis Pilot\n\nCiti is one of 17 international banks \npiloting the Paris Agreement \nCapital Transition Assessment \n(PACTA) methodology for climate \nscenario analysis of corporate \nlending portfolios, developed by \nthe 2\u00b0 Investing Initiative. This \nmethodology allows banks to study \nthe alignment of their corporate \nlending portfolios with different \n2\u00b0C and below benchmarks based \non the assets, technologies, and \ncapital expenditure and produc-\ntion plans of companies in their \nportfolios. \n\n11\n\n\f##PAGE_BREAK##Contents \n\n  Our Approach to ESG\u2003\n\n  Solutions for Impact \n\n  How We Do Business \n\n  Appendices      \u2003\u2003\u2003\u2003\u2003\u2003 \n\nCiti and the Task Force  \non Climate-related  \nFinancial Disclosures\n\nCiti has long recognized the global \nchallenge of climate change; we released \nour first Climate Change Position \nStatement in 2007. In 2017, our CEO \nsigned a statement of support for the \nrecommendations of the Task Force on \nClimate-related Financial Disclosures, \nwith the understanding that Citi needed \nto continue to build on its strong foun-\ndation of climate-related activity and \ndisclosure. Our objective is to understand \nthe potential financial risks to Citi, our \nclients and communities from climate \nchange, how Citi and our clients may be \ncontributing to climate change, and how \nwe can help our clients transition to a \nlow-carbon economy. \n\nWe conducted a TCFD gap analysis and \nidentified the climate scenario analy-\nsis recommendation as a key area of \ndevelopment for Citi and our sector. We \ncollaborated with the UN Environment \nProgramme Finance Initiative (UNEP FI) \u2014  \na global, UN\u2013private sector collaboration \nwith more than 240 finance institutions \nas members \u2014 and 15 other banks to \n\nInternational Climate \nReporting Awards\n\nCiti was one of six global financial \ninstitutions awarded an International \nClimate Reporting Award for inno-\nvation and best practices. Citi was \nrecognized for reporting related to \nclimate risk assessment and risk \nmanagement in our 2018 TCFD \nreport. The awards were jointly \norganized by the French Environment \nand Energy Management Agency and \nthe French Ministry for Ecological \nand Inclusive Transition. \n\ndesign a banking-sector climate scenario \nanalysis pilot project. As part of this \npilot, we looked at transition risk under \n1.5\u00b0C and 2\u00b0C scenarios for our North \nAmerican oil and gas exploration and \nproduction portfolio and our U.S. power \nportfolio, as well as physical risk under a \n4\u00b0C scenario for our U.S. power portfolio. \nIn late 2018, we published our first TCFD \nreport, Finance for a Climate-Resilient \nFuture, in which we disclosed our TCFD \nimplementation across the four pillars of \nGovernance, Strategy, Risk Management \nand Metrics and Targets, including the \nresults of our scenario analysis pilot \nproject. \n\nFollowing the release of that report, we \nconvened a half-day investor dialogue in \nFebruary 2019 with Ceres, a climate- \nfocused nonprofit organization, during \nwhich a group of institutional and ESG \ninvestors provided feedback on our TCFD \nimplementation and disclosures to date. \nWe learned that investors valued the \nlevel of transparency, effort and detail \nprovided in our reporting, appreciated the \nstandalone report and were interested \nin seeing TCFD references in financial \nreporting and our Proxy Statement. We \nelicited these investors\u2019 feedback on a \nnumber of potential actions Citi could \ntake on our TCFD journey, including:\n\n \u2022 Continuing to enhance our climate \n\nrisk governance\n\n \u2022 Supplementing our scenario anal-\nysis pilot work with a shorter-term \nclimate stress test, given the lack of \nalignment between the shorter time \nhorizon of loans and the longer time \nhorizon of climate change scenarios\n\n \u2022 Looking into third-party method-\n\nologies, including the 2\u00b0 Investing \nInitiative\u2019s PACTA tool and the \nPartnership for Carbon Accounting \nFinancials, to analyze the alignment \nof our portfolio with the Paris \nAgreement goal to limit warming to \nwell below 2\u00b0C, and/or to measure \nthe carbon associated with our loan \nportfolio\n\n \u2022 Enhancing our approach to analyzing \n\nthe climate risk of our clients in \ncarbon-intensive sectors \n\n \u2022 Providing more metrics and setting \ntargets related to the carbon intensi-\nty of our credit portfolios\n\n \u2022 Conducting an assessment of physi-\n\ncal climate risk and risks to Citi\u2019s own \nfacilities, as a complement to our \nbusiness continuity planning\n\n \u2022 Collaborating with others to nor-\n\nmalize climate disclosure, further \ndeveloping and standardizing climate \nscenario analysis and reporting, and \ndisclosing our learnings as we go\n\nWith feedback from our investors on \nhow we might prioritize these numerous \npotential next steps, along with ongoing \nconversations with regulators and our \nlessons learned from our first phase of \nimplementation, in 2019 we embarked on \nphase two of our TCFD efforts.  \n\nOur 2020 TCFD implementation plan \nincludes activities across the following \nthree integrated pillars and builds in \nopportunities for investor feedback, peer \ncollaboration and quick learning so that \nwe can course correct as needed:\n\n1.

We \nalso plan to increase training on climate \nrisk internally to build awareness and \ncapacity.\n\nWe are still in a relatively early stage \nof extensive climate scenario analysis \nbut consider deepening our analysis of \nclimate-related risks and opportunities \nfundamental to our sustainability \ngoals and overall corporate strategy. \nTransparency and disclosure are critical \nto our efforts, and we continue to high-\nlight relevant climate disclosures in this \nreport. The TCFD Index indicates where \nrelated content can be found throughout \nthe report. We plan to publish an update \non our TCFD efforts in late 2020. \n\nCiti and the Principles for \nResponsible Banking\n\nIn 2019, Citi became the first major U.S. \nbank to endorse and become a signatory \nto the Principles for Responsible Banking, \njoining more than 100 banks around the \nworld supporting this important effort. \nThe Principles were developed by the \nbanking industry itself, facilitated by \nUNEP FI.\n\nThese Principles, which define what it \nmeans to be a responsible bank, are \ndesigned to enable all banks to implement \nthem, no matter their specific context. \nThe Principles also provide the frame-\nwork for a sustainable banking system, to \nguide the industry in demonstrating how \nit contributes to society, with an aim to \naccelerate its contribution to achieving \nthe UN Sustainable Development Goals \nand the Paris Agreement.\n\n13\n\nClimate Scenario Analysis\n\nClimate scenario analysis is still nascent within the financial sector. We \nbegan piloting long-term climate scenario analysis in 2017\u20132018, building on \na number of different types of climate risk analyses that Citi had conducted \nover the previous few years. We undertook our first climate-related stress \ntest, a drought stress test, back in 2016, in collaboration with the Natural \nCapital Finance Alliance and UNEP FI. We followed this up in 2017 with a \nstranded asset analysis to understand the likelihood that upstream oil and \ngas assets in our energy portfolio would lose value because of a carbon price \nand how that would impact clients\u2019 credit quality. More information about \nthese analyses is available in our 2017 Global Citizenship Report.\n\nWe continue to collaborate with our peers to refine the methodologies and \ntools developed during the UNEP FI pilot and to implement them more \nbroadly. For example, through Citibanamex\u2019s participation in phase two of \nthe UNEP FI pilot project we are expanding our scenario analysis to cover \nadditional sectors and geographies. In addition, we are continuing to partner \nwith climate scenario modelers from the Potsdam Institute for Climate Impact \nResearch and the International Institute for Applied Systems Analysis to \ndevelop disorderly transition scenarios suitable for financial analysis and plan \nto test these additional scenarios. We are also piloting and exploring other \nmethodologies and tools, such as the 2\u00b0 Investing Initiative\u2019s PACTA tool.\n\n\f##PAGE_BREAK##Contents \n\n  Our Approach to ESG\u2003\n\n  Solutions for Impact \n\n  How We Do Business \n\n  Appendices      \u2003\u2003\u2003\u2003\u2003\u2003 \n\nTCFD Implementation Highlights\n\nPhase 1 (2017\u20132018)\n\nRisk Policies\n\n \u2022 Updated our ESRM Policy with new restrictions on financing for the construction or \n\nexpansion of coal-fired power plants \n\nClimate Scenario Analysis\n\n \u2022 Co-developed methodologies with UNEP FI and 15 other banks, and conducted a pilot \nclimate scenario analysis looking at transition risk (1.5\u00b0C and 2\u00b0C) associated with our \nNorth America oil & gas exploration and production and U.S. power portfolios, and \nphysical risk (4\u00b0C) associated with our U.S. power portfolio\n\nLearnings\n\n \u2022 A cross-functional team is required, \n\nincluding Environmental and Social Risk \nManagement; Credit Risk; Quantitative \nRisk and Stress Testing; Sustainability & \nESG; and Banking.\n\n \u2022 Sectors are heterogeneous, and some \n\nclients are more resilient than others to \nclimate stresses due to factors such as \ncost structure.\n\nTCFD Disclosure \n\n \u2022 Published our first TCFD report, Finance for a Climate-Resilient Future\n\nChallenges\n\n \u2022 Long-term orderly transition scenarios \nare not reflective of how climate risks \nare likely to evolve and are insufficient \nfor understanding impacts on shorter- \nterm credit portfolios.\n\n \u2022 There are continued data challenges and \n\nlimitations with existing methodologies \nand tools available for climate risk \nassessment. \n\nChallenges Ahead\n\n \u2022 Data challenges remain, including incom-\n\nplete data for some client segments, \nwhich will need to be overcome.\n\n \u2022 Determining which methodologies are \n\noptimal is essential, as road testing \ndifferent approaches is time and \nresource intensive. \n\n \u2022 Methodologies for assessing the carbon \n\nintensity and emissions of loan portfolios \nare still in \u201cbeta testing\u201d mode and \nremain controversial.\n\nPhase 2 (2019\u20132020)\n\nRisk Policies\n\n \u2022 Updating our ESRM sector standards for coal mining and coal-fired power and expand-\n\ning the climate risk section of our ESRM Policy\n\n \u2022 Established a global, cross-functional Climate Risk Working Group\n\n \u2022\n\nIncorporated climate risk into our material risk inventory and risk taxonomy \n\nClimate Scenario Analysis\n\n \u2022 Stress testing the resilience of our global oil and gas exploration and production port-\n\nfolio to understand the impacts of a rapidly instituted carbon price (e.g., $50/ton of \ncarbon dioxide from 2019 to 2021)\n\n \u2022 Conducting a physical risk assessment of Citi\u2019s own facilities to understand our exposure \n\nto various climate hazards and the resilience of our operations \n\nCarbon Measurement\n\n \u2022 Road testing the PACTA methodology to analyze the alignment of our credit portfolios \n\nwith 2\u00b0C scenarios \n\n \u2022 Assess the PCAF, the Science Based Targets initiative and other initiatives\n\nTCFD Disclosure\n\n \u2022 Convened an investor roundtable to obtain feedback and input on our TCFD strategy, \n\nimplementation and disclosure\n\n \u2022 Publish our second TCFD report in late 2020, describing learnings from our current \n\nefforts \n\n14\n\nCiti 2019 ESG Report\f##PAGE_BREAK##Citi and the \nSustainable \nDevelopment Goals\n\nGiven our global footprint and our role \nin financing economies around the \nworld, Citi has an important role to \nplay in achieving the UN Sustainable \nDevelopment Goals (SDGs). Throughout \nthis report, we have made an effort to \nindicate where information is relevant to \naction on the SDGs. While our work and \nthe content of this report cover many \nSDGs, we have identified seven goals on \nwhich we can have the greatest impact.\n\nIn 2019, Citi joined with the UN and other \nbusiness leaders to create the Global \nInvestors for Sustainable Development \n(GISD) Alliance, which promises to do \nmore to address the multitrillion-dollar \nshortfall in funding for the UN\u2019s goals. \nThe 30 members have committed to \nscale up our collective efforts to align our \nbusinesses with the goals and to remove \nbarriers to finance. The GISD Alliance \nwill operate on a two-year timeline, from \nOctober 2019 through October 2021, \nfocusing on solutions related to long-term \nSDG investment, particularly in developing \ncountries. \n\nCiti GPS, our premiere thought leadership \nproduct designed to help navigate the \neconomy\u2019s most demanding challenges, \nuses the SDGs among other global refer-\nence points to inform strategic insight on \ntopics such as single-use plastics and the \ntransition to more responsible production \nand consumption of plastics and other \npackaging materials. Citi GPS released a \nreport in 2018 that aimed to simplify the \nSDGs and identify the incremental finan-\ncial costs and opportunities of achieving \nthe individual goals and the human benefit \nthat might be gained by solving them. \n\nThese 17 interrelated Sustainable Development Goals represent an \nambitious agenda to achieve a sustainable future by 2030.

We rely on a variety of partner-\nships \u2014 with clients, governments, \nnongovernmental organizations (NGOs), \nacademic institutions, and companies \nranging from startups to large, multi-\nnational corporations \u2014 to succeed. \nThese partnerships highlight how our \nwork contributes directly to SDG 17, \nwhich seeks to strengthen the means \nof implementation and revitalize the \nglobal partnership for sustainable \ndevelopment. In particular, Citi\u2019s efforts \ncontribute to target 17.3, which seeks to \nmobilize additional financial resources \nfor developing countries from multiple \nsources, including the private sector, to \nensure sufficient financing is available to \nachieve the SDGs. \n\n \nSDG Goal 17: Partnerships for the Goals \n\nInnovative Local \nGovernment and \nCommunity Change \nAgents\n\nIncreasingly, local governments and \ncommunity organizations are playing a \ncentral role as change agents, leading \non a wide array of issues, including \ninfrastructure, employment, housing \nand financial health. Moreover, these \nentities often do so while facing signif-\nicant budget and resource constraints. \nA core pillar of our efforts to invest \nin local communities is to collaborate \nwith \u2014 and provide financial solutions \nto \u2014 local governments and community \norganizations. \n\nPublic-Sector and  \nInstitutional Financing\n\nWe provide a broad range of banking and \nfinancial products and services, advice \nand support to public-sector clients, such \nas government agencies, central banks, \ndevelopment organizations, NGOs and \nacademic institutions, to enable them to \nmore effectively provide critical services \nto local communities. \n\nCiti is uniquely positioned to support \nlarge, global organizations that are in \nneed of rapid solutions to solve complex \nproblems. For example, in Costa Rica in \n2019, we supported the payment needs \nof the International Federation of Red \nCross and Red Crescent Societies. The \nRed Cross is responsible for operating a \nlarge fleet of emergency response ambu-\nlances, with fuel costs funded by Costa \nRica\u2019s Ministry of Finance. Historically, \nambulance drivers were given paper \nvouchers reflecting an approved \nmonthly fuel allowance. The vouchers \nwere accepted at most (but not all) fuel \nstations and were occasionally lost or \ndamaged, rendering them invalid, leaving \nambulances without fuel and putting lives \nat risk. The Red Cross collected used \n\nvouchers monthly, reconciling and consol-\nidating the fuel expenses, which were \nthen reported to the Ministry of Finance \nfor validation. This manual process was \nlabor-intensive and time-consuming.\n\nAt the request of the Red Cross, Citi \ndeveloped and implemented a tailored \npurchase card program to replace the \npaper voucher model. The now-automated \nsystem not only ensures that ambulance \ndrivers have access to fuel, it has also \nimproved efficiency and reduced costs for \nthe Red Cross. \n\nMany institutional investors are looking \nfor returns beyond profit, and Citi offers \nproducts to meet this intent. Thematic \nbonds \u2014 such as social, green and \nsustainability bonds \u2014 provide a way for \ninvestors to see yields while also contrib-\nuting to positive environmental and social \nsolutions. Thematic bonds continue to \nevolve to address changing needs and \nissues, and Citi works closely with clients \nand partners on new products. To learn \nmore about Citi\u2019s efforts to promote \nthe growth of thematic bonds, including \ngreen and sustainability bonds, visit the \nEnvironmental Finance section. \n\nPhilanthropic Efforts \n\nAround the world, NGOs make valuable \ncontributions to addressing difficult social \nproblems. But they need funding and \nother resources to amplify the impact of \ntheir work or to pursue as-yet-unproven \nsolutions that can be tested and later \nbrought to scale. This is often where \nCiti and the Citi Foundation can play an \neffective role. Moreover, by helping city \nleaders develop technology-driven solu-\ntions to urban challenges, our initiatives \nhelp support SDG 9, which promotes \ninclusive and sustainable industrializa-\ntion and fosters innovation. \n\nSDG Goal 9: Industry, Innovation and \nInfrastructure\n\n25\n\n\f##PAGE_BREAK##Contents \n\n  Our Approach to ESG \n\n  Solutions for Impact \n\n  How We Do Business \n\n  Appendices             \n\nEconomic Transformation Through Digital Technologies\nDigital technologies (especially relating to connectivity, big data and artificial intel-\nligence) are transforming every facet of the economy \u2014 globally and locally. With \npublic-sector expenditure in most countries accounting for anywhere from one-third \nto two-thirds of gross domestic product, it has become imperative for governments \nto drive digitization efforts. A strong digital economy requires a robust digital infra-\nstructure, with digital money, payments and identity all required for the transforma-\ntion of any industry or society. Citi\u2019s Digital Money Index, published annually since \n2014, helps governments understand their respective countries\u2019 readiness for usage \nof digital money. Each step taken toward digital money readiness can enhance a \nnation\u2019s ability to transform its economy. According to the Digital Money Index, even \na 10 percent increase in digital money readiness could help up to 220 million individ-\nuals enter the formal financial sector. A recent Citi Global Perspectives & Solutions \n(Citi GPS) report highlights the digitization of government, offering examples and \ncase studies of how countries are progressing on their digital journeys.\n\nCities for Citizenship\n\nIn 2014, Citi became the founding corpo-\nrate partner of Cities for Citizenship \n(C4C), a nonpartisan national initiative \naimed at promoting and expanding \nAmerican citizenship and financial capa-\nbility among lawful permanent residents \nin the U.S. What began with just three \ncities (New York City, Chicago and Los \nAngeles) has since grown to a network  \nof 92 American cities and counties.\n\nC4C celebrated its fifth anniversary in \nSeptember 2019 with 45 local citizen-\nship events across the country. Since \nthe program\u2019s launch, the network has \nreached nearly 1.8 million people who \nattended citizenship-related program-\nming, helped more than 48,000 people \ninitiate the citizenship process and/\nor apply for citizenship and connected \n30,000 individuals with financial \nempowerment services. C4C, which \nis also supported by the Center for \nPopular Democracy and the National \nPartnership for New Americans, plans \nto expand to 100 cities and counties in \n2020. In September, Citi was recognized \nby the United Nations Association, \nSouthern California Division, for our \nrole in catalyzing and scaling immigrant \nintegration efforts.\n\nFinancing Sustainable Cities  \nInitiative\n\nThe Financing Sustainable Cities Initiative \n(FSCI), a partnership funded by the Citi \nFoundation, aims to help educate cities \nabout how to accelerate and scale up \ntheir investments in sustainable urban \nsolutions. In 2015, the Foundation \nteamed up with the WRI Ross Center for \nSustainable Cities and the C40 Cities \nClimate Leadership Group to help reduce \nglobal greenhouse gas emissions and \nimprove quality of life for urban residents \naround the world. Areas of focus include \nbike sharing systems, low- and zero-emis-\nsion buses, rapid transit, transit-oriented \ndevelopment and affordable housing.\n\nThe FSCI consists of two primary \ncomponents:\n\n \u2022 Peer-to-peer learning communities \nthrough which cities can share their \nexperiences developing sustainable \nprojects\n\n \u2022 Direct technical assistance to cities \ndeveloping sustainable finance strat-\negies and projects\n\nIn 2019, C40 Cities released a report \nshowcasing early results of the initiative.     \n\n26\n\nCommunity Progress Makers Fund\n\nThe Community Progress Makers Fund \nsupports high-impact community \norganizations that are driving economic \nprogress in their communities.

In the U.S., the American \nSociety of Civil Engineers estimates there \nwill be a $1.5 trillion shortfall between the \namount of infrastructure needed and the \namount actually funded by 2025.\n\nPublic- and private-sector stakeholders \nneed to work together to find ways to \novercome investment barriers to much-\nneeded infrastructure projects. Citi \nfinances billions in infrastructure projects \naround the world. Between 2014 and \n2019, we provided more than $13 billion \nin green building and sustainable trans-\nportation projects. These activities, which \n\nwere counted toward our $100 Billion \nEnvironmental Finance Goal, are helping \ncities meet the needs of rapid urbanization \nand work toward SDG 9, which commits to \nbuild resilient infrastructure, promote \ninclusive and sustainable industrializa-\ntion and foster innovation, as well as SDG \n11, which aims to make cities and human \nsettlements inclusive, safe, resilient \nand sustainable.

This work aligns with SDG target \n11.1, which includes providing access for \nall to adequate, safe and affordable \nhousing and basic services. \n\nSDG Goal 11: Sustainable Cities and \nCommunities \n\nFinancing Affordable \nHousing\n\nWe offer a range of housing financing \nsolutions \u2014 including construction and \npermanent lending, tax credit equity, and \nFannie Mae and Freddie Mac mortgage \nbanking \u2014 to affordable housing devel-\nopers. We focus on projects that serve \nlow-income and special needs popula-\ntions, including seniors, individuals with \ndisabilities and people who are homeless. \nOur work goes beyond just housing; we \nalso finance projects critical to strong \nand vibrant communities such as schools, \nhealthcare facilities and businesses \nthat contribute to revitalization.

The property will include \naccess to a full range of supportive \nservices for adults and children. The \nentire building is reserved for residents \nwith income from 30 to 60 percent of the \narea median income.\n\nOlder members of the LGBT+ community \nface high rates of discrimination, includ-\ning when seeking affordable housing. Citi \npartners with SAGE, one of the oldest \nnonprofit organizations dedicated to the \nneeds of the elder LGBT+ constituency in \nthe U.S., to help ensure that communities \nare equipped to support aging LGBT+ \nresidents through capacity building, \nconsumer education, advocacy, training \nand the construction of more LGBT+-\nwelcoming housing. In October 2019, \nwith support from Citi, SAGE brought \ntogether housing developers, nonprofit \npractitioners and policy experts from \nacross the nation for an inaugural LGBT \nElder Housing Symposium in Washington, \nD.C.

Citi also \nsupported the home project \nwith funding as part of Bring \nThem HOMES. \n\nHousing for U.S.  \nVeterans\n\nOn any given night in America, an estimated  \n38,000 veterans are homeless.2 Many of them  \nstruggle with lingering trauma or suffer from  \nvarious physical or mental disabilities. Since 2012, \nCiti has supported LISC and the National Equity \nFund\u2019s Bring Them HOMES initiative, which finances, \nfacilitates, advocates for and implements affordable \nhousing options for veterans. To date, a total of  \n5,000 affordable housing units, including 3,100  \nspecifically for veterans, have been completed  \nor are in development.\n\nFor example, thanks to support from Citi, \nSkid Row Housing Trust built an afford-\nable housing project in Los Angeles called \nThe Six, which now provides housing \nand services to veterans.

As \na leading supporter of CLTs in the U.S., \nCiti has invested approximately $7 million \nin seeding new CLTs in places like Miami, \nNew York City and Washington, D.C. On \nLong Island, which suffered significant \ndamage from Hurricane Sandy in 2012, \nthe Long Island Partnership Community \nLand Trust has committed to building \nover three dozen affordable homes \u2014 \nseveral of which have been completed \nand now house residents \u2014 thanks in \npart to a $1.2 million investment from \nCiti. In New York City, the mayor recently \ncommitted to CLT units for 3,000 \nfamilies, building on Citi\u2019s $1.5 million \ninvestment in the Interboro Community \nLand Trust.\n\nIn San Francisco, it is nearly impossible \nfor affordable housing developers to \ncompete with private developers in one \nof the most expensive, cash-driven real \nestate marketplaces in the country. \nThat\u2019s why Citi worked with the City of \nSan Francisco to create the San Francisco \nHousing Accelerator Fund (SFHAF) \u2014 an \ninnovative nonprofit vehicle that enables \nmission-driven housing developers to \nmore nimbly and sustainably build and \npreserve affordable housing. Since its \nlaunch in 2017, SFHAF has funded the \npreservation and construction of 433 \nunits, including a historic Mission Street \nbuilding that will provide eight apart-\nments for low- and moderate-income \nhouseholds. The acquisition is also \nhelping to preserve El Rio, a popular bar \nand cultural landmark that has served the \nlocal Latino and LGBT+ communities for \nmore than 40 years.\n\nIn New York, Citi has invested $1.2 million \nin the Joint Ownership Entity NYC \n(JOE NYC), which is enabling neighbor-\nhood-based nonprofit housing organiza-\ntions to aggregate their affordable units \nto achieve economies of scale. Together, \nthese organizations are creating one of \nthe city\u2019s largest nonprofit housing port-\nfolios. JOE NYC is on track to own 3,500 \naffordable apartments by 2020.\n\nBeyond homeownership, in cities such as \nSan Francisco and Washington, D.C., Citi \nhas financed nonprofits that are trying to \nboost affordable rentals through acces-\nsory dwelling units (ADUs) \u2014 secondary \ndwellings on a housing parcel, such \nas basements, garage apartments or \nseparate freestanding structures. ADUs \nbenefit homeowners by creating income \nstreams while adding more affordable \nhousing in residential neighborhoods. \nIn Washington, D.C., for example, the \nnonprofit United Planning Organization is \nteaching residents how to take advantage \nof zoning regulations that allow for the \nbuilding of ADUs. By educating qualified \nhomeowners on how to design, permit \nand build ADUs on their properties, \nhomeowners can increase property \nvalues, age in place, build intergenera-\ntional wealth and grow new skill sets in \ndevelopment and property management. \n\nThriving Small \nBusinesses\n\nAccording to the U.S. Small Business \nAdministration, small businesses are at \nthe forefront of economic growth. Yet \nthey often face difficulties accessing \nthe capital and development resources \nneeded to thrive and grow. Through \ndirect financing and partnerships with \ncommunity organizations and local \ngovernments, we support the growth of \nsmall businesses and their contributions \nto the broader economic ecosystem in \ncountries around the world. In 2019, Citi \ninvested more than $10.6 billion in small \nbusiness lending in the U.S.\n\n32\n\nCiti 2019 ESG Report\f##PAGE_BREAK##d.light, a social enterprise, received \n$5 million in financing to expand \naccess to off-grid solar energy in \nKenya through Scaling Enterprise.\n\nEmpowering Mission- \nDriven Enterprises\n\nCiti supports mission-driven enterprises that are working to build more equitable \ncommunities. In early 2020, we launched a $150 million venture capital fund that \nwill allow us to make investments in U.S. companies that are addressing societal \nchallenges. The Citi Impact Fund will prioritize companies that are led or owned \nby women or minorities and that are using technology and innovation to help \naddress four key societal challenges. \n\nCiti\u2019s Impact Fund focuses on four key areas:\n\nWorkforce  \nDevelopment\nSolutions that train  \nand connect people \n\nFinancial \nCapability\nSolutions that \n\nPhysical & Social \nInfrastructure\n\nSolutions that improve an  \n\nincrease access to the \n\nindividual\u2019s way of life \n\nto careers\n\nfinancial system\n\nthrough housing, healthcare \n\nSustainability\n\nSolutions that address \nissues related to energy, \n water and sustainable  \n\nproduction\n\nand transportation\n\nThe fund, which is one of the largest stand-\nalone impact investing funds in the financial \nsector, will highlight the ability to achieve \nboth healthy financial returns and positive \nsocial impact. It builds on and complements \nour other efforts to expand access to early- \nstage financing by companies that are \naddressing community challenges.\n\nOne example of these other efforts is \nScaling Enterprise, a $100 million loan \nguarantee facility launched in 2019 by Citi, \nthe U.S. International Development Finance \n\nCorporation (formerly OPIC) and the Ford \nFoundation. Through this facility, we are \nable to provide earlier-stage financing in \nlocal currency to companies that expand \naccess to products and services for low- \nincome communities in emerging markets. \nLoans and working capital in local currency \nand at affordable rates can enable inno-\nvative social impact companies to achieve \nscale, greater efficiencies and lower costs. \nScaling Enterprise will facilitate vital growth \nfinancing to companies that are expanding \naccess to finance, agriculture, energy, \n\naffordable housing, water and sanitation \nto low-income households in emerging \nmarkets. In the first two transactions \nunder Scaling Enterprise, the partners \nhave committed $5 million in financing to \nInI Farms to help smallholder banana and \npomegranate farmers in India access export \nmarkets and increase incomes by up to  \n20 percent, as well as $5 million in financing \nto d.light to expand access to off-grid solar \nenergy in Kenya.\n\n33\n\n\f##PAGE_BREAK##Contents \n\n  Our Approach to ESG \n\n  Solutions for Impact \n\n  How We Do Business \n\n  Appendices             \n\nSupporting Women- and \nMinority-Owned Small \nBusinesses\n\nThe gender and race gaps in the world \nof small businesses are very real, with \nreports showing that less than 3 percent \nof venture capital funding is allocated to \nwomen- and minority-owned startups. \nIn New York City, for example, there are \nalmost 360,000 female entrepreneurs \nwho contribute approximately $50 billion \nannually in revenue to the city\u2019s economy. \nYet research by Citi found that men own \n1.5 times the number of businesses, \nhave 3.5 times the number of employees \nand generate 4.5 times the amount of \nrevenue.\n\nCiti aims to change the statistics for \nwomen- and minority-owned businesses by \n\ninvesting in programs that emphasize \nentrepreneurship, employee ownership \nand local contracting. We support these \nefforts through a number of partnerships, \nincluding the following:\n\nWE NYC has surpassed its initial goal \nof serving 5,000 women by helping \nmore than 6,000 female entrepre-\nneurs develop their ideas and expand \ntheir enterprises.\n\n \u2022 Women Entrepreneurs NYC (WE NYC) \nwas launched by the NYC Department \nof Small Business Services in 2015 \nto connect aspiring and established \nfemale entrepreneurs to the re-\nsources, education and community \nservices needed to build thriving \nbusinesses. Citi supported the initial \nresearch study that defined the \nprogram design as well as WE Master \nMoney: Credit, connecting women \nwith credit-building workshops and \none-on-one counseling to help them \nmanage credit and access more \nloans, thereby building credit and \nfinancial resilience. Since its launch, \n\n \u2022 The National Coalition for Asian \n\nPacific American Community \nDevelopment issued a report sup-\nported by Citi called Small Business, \nBig Dreams, which highlights \nhow entrepreneurship is a critical \nasset-building pathway for many \nmembers of the Asian American and \nPacific Islander (AAPI) community. \nAAPI immigrants start businesses at \na higher rate than the general U.S. \npopulation, yet they face significant \nobstacles to business growth, includ-\ning language barriers and limited \naccess to capital. \n\nShinar Little (far right), owner of FogHill, Inc., stands with some of his employees outside of Georgetown University. Little benefited from the DC Community \nAnchor Partnership, a program that connects local, minority-owned firms with leading university and health system organizations in the nation\u2019s capital.

In the U.S., more than  \n1 million business owners of color are \nnearing retirement. Collectively, they \nemploy more than 8.2 million people \nand generate more than $1.2 trillion \nin annual revenue. Yet fewer than \n20 percent of these business owners \nhave post-retirement succession \nplans. In Washington, D.C., where \nnearly 40 percent of Black business \nowners are nearing retirement age, \nCiti supports the D.C. Employee \nOwnership Initiative to preserve \nlegacy businesses and create new \npathways to entrepreneurship. We \nalso support Project Equity, a non-\nprofit that helps retiring business \nowners transfer company ownership \nto employees to preserve small \nbusinesses in Southern California  \nand South Florida.\n\n \u2022 In Los Angeles, Citi was the founding \n\ncorporate sponsor of a regional \ncollaborative launched to make it \neasier for small businesses to bid for \nlocal contracts worth more than  \n$1 billion. Small business owners have \nfor years battled with a fragmented, \nantiquated and complex contract pro-\ncurement system in the Los Angeles \narea. The newly launched OneLA \nRegional Collaborative establishes \na partnership between some of the \nlargest public agencies in the region \nseeking to connect diverse business-\nes to technical assistance, business \nresources and public and private \ncontracting opportunities. The new \nsystem will streamline and speed up \nthe procurement process and give \nsmall businesses a fairer shot as they \ncompete for contracts. \n\nLearn how we are supporting women-  \nand minority-owned small businesses in \nour own supply chain in the Operations \nand Supply Chain section.\n\nMicrofinance as a Path to Women\u2019s Economic \nEmpowerment  \n\nCiti has partnered with the U.S. International Development Finance \nCorporation (DFC, formerly known as OPIC) to expand microfinance loans \nto women in emerging markets around the world. In 2019, we committed \nto work with the DFC, the U.S. Agency for International Development and \nprivate-sector partners to mobilize an additional $500 million for women in \nLatin America. In Tunisia, we recently announced the launch of a $10 million \nloan guarantee facility, which will provide growth financing to more than \n17,000 microentrepreneurs, approximately 65 percent of them women. And \nin Jordan, Citi provided $5 million to Microfund for Women, which will now be \nable to give loans to an additional 10,000 underserved Jordanian women.\n\nCiti also has partnered with CreditAccess Grameen, which was born out of \nthe need to provide timely and affordable credit to low-income households in \nIndia. Women in India make up 60 percent of the country\u2019s unbanked popula-\ntion of 190 million people. In 2019, Citi provided $29.5 million to CreditAccess \nGrameen to help reach an additional 75,000 women with an average loan size \nof $390.\n\nMicrofinance loan programs are typically associated with emerging markets, \nwhile the need for such programs in industrialized countries such as the U.S. \nis often underappreciated. A decade ago, Citi collaborated with Grameen \nAmerica to help establish the organization\u2019s first office in Queens, New York. \nGrameen America members \u2014 who are all minority and immigrant women \nliving on lower wages \u2014 are provided with microloans, fee-waived Citi savings \naccounts, peer support and financial education to help them expand their \nbusinesses and generate income for themselves and their families. Grameen \nAmerica released early results of the most rigorous, independent, third-party \nevaluation of group microfinance in the U.S. to date, which was produced with \nfunding from Citi. This important preliminary research on Grameen America\u2019s \nlending program demonstrates that helping women build positive credit histo-\nries and raise credit scores is a powerful approach to expanding economic \nopportunity for fledgling entrepreneurs. Since launching in 2008, more than \n129,000 women have received over $1.4 billion in microloans through this \nprogram to start and grow their businesses \u2014 with 99 percent repayment.  \n\nMost microfinance beneficiaries globally are women, making Citi\u2019s work on \nmicrofinance a direct contributor to SDG 5, in support of gender equality and \nempowerment for all women and girls, and in particular target 5.a, which \nstrives for a range of gender-related objectives, including giving women \nequal rights to economic resources.\n\nSDG Goal 5: Gender Equality\n\n35\n\n\f##PAGE_BREAK##Contents \n\n  Our Approach to ESG \n\n  Solutions for Impact \n\n  How We Do Business \n\n  Appendices             \n\nPreserving Local Jobs \n\nCiti works with public and private part-\nners to help remove the individual and \nsystemic barriers to success for current \nand aspiring small business owners, such \nas access to capital and affordable space, \nas well as roadblocks to entrepreneur-\nship. Because the specific challenges \nfacing entrepreneurs often vary by city \nand region, we engage with local entities \nto implement thoughtful solutions. \n\nIn New York City, Citi partners with LISC \nNYC and the NYC Department of Small \nBusiness Services to help revitalize \ncommercial corridors and small busi-\nnesses across the city. Community orga-\nnizations apply for funding and access \nto expertise to implement initiatives that \nare most valuable to their corridors. \nThe organizations focus on storefront \nimprovements, such as new signage and \nlighting, as well as broader efforts aimed \nat boosting foot traffic, increasing sales \nand contributing to a greater sense of \nsafety. \n\nUrban manufacturing also holds great \npromise as a path to higher-wage employ-\nment and greater economic security. New \nYork City has made development of the \nindustrial and manufacturing sector a key \ncomponent of its strategy to create more \nliving-wage employment. Together, Citi \nand the Association for Neighborhood \nand Housing Development launched the \nUrban Manufacturing Accelerator Fund \nto create and preserve quality manufac-\nturing jobs in New York City. The Fund \nprovides frontline resources that enable \nnonprofit developers to more effectively \nacquire and renovate manufacturing \nspace by leveraging financing from the \nNYC Economic Development Corporation.\n\nIn Brooklyn, a $6.85 million warehouse \nrenovation project will create 10,000 \nsquare feet of industrial space to be \nleased at affordable rates for local \nindustrial businesses and manufacturers. \nThe project is one example of progress in \nthe City of New York\u2019s 10-point Industrial \nAction Plan, which is aimed at growing \n\n21st century industrial and manufacturing \njobs in New York City. In the Bronx, a \nmixed-use, 50,000-square-foot industrial \nspace that will create industrial and \ncommercial space, as well as 740 housing \nunits and open workspaces, will open \nin three phases by 2024. The Urban \nManufacturing Accelerator Fund helped \nto catalyze both projects.\n\nFinancial Inclusion\n\nMost people can easily comprehend the \neconomic and social case for ensuring \nthat all households have access to the \nfinancial products and services they \nneed. But to develop solutions that meet \nthe needs of underserved households, we \nneed to understand the financial behav-\niors of customers who are at risk of being \n\nexcluded. Without that, even the most \ninnovative and thoughtfully developed \nproducts will fail.\n\nCiti works to develop solutions that are \nsafe, transparent and accessible \u2014 ones \nthat provide real economic value, includ-\ning for those whose financial needs are \ncurrently unmet. We seek out innovative \npartnerships with financial institutions, \ntelecommunications and fintech provid-\ners, government agencies, consumer \ngoods companies and others that have \nclose relationships with the unbanked and \nthe underserved segments of society. \nOur partners are trusted leaders in their \nsectors who understand the needs of \ntheir local markets. \n\nSuccess also requires setting public \npolicy priorities and building the industry. \n\nFinancial Inclusion and the SDGs\nAn estimated 1.7 billion adults around the world, in both developing and developed \nmarkets, remain outside the formal banking sector. To improve access for these people, \nbanks need to understand and address the mistrust of financial institutions among many \ntraditionally underbanked communities and also invest in innovative products that meet \ntheir unique needs. We offer a variety of products, tools and services that help improve \nfinancial resiliency and inclusion in these communities and partner with organizations \nthat are increasing access to financial services and providing educational resources to \nresidents.\n\nOur extensive work on financial inclusion contributes to progress on SDG 8, which aims, \namong other things, to provide full and productive employment and decent work for \nall. For example, Citi\u2019s work on financial inclusion around the world contributes to target \n8.10, which aims to strengthen the capacity of domestic financial institutions to  \nencourage and expand access to banking, insurance and financial services for all. \n\nInclusive finance is also a key success factor for progress on SDG 9, which aims to build \nresilient infrastructure, promote inclusive and sustainable industrialization and  \nfoster innovation, specifically enabling progress on target 9.3, which seeks to increase \nthe access of small-scale enterprises, particularly in developing countries, to  \nfinancial services to facilitate integration into value chains and markets. \n\nSDG Goal 8: Decent Work and Economic Growth \n\nSDG Goal 9: Industry, Innovation and Infrastructure \n\n36\n\nCiti 2019 ESG Report\f##PAGE_BREAK##For example, the Citi Foundation has \nsupported the Better Than Cash Alliance \nat the United Nations; the Alliance works \nwith governments and businesses around \nthe world to introduce public policy, regu-\nlations and best practices that accelerate \ndigital platforms and financial access.

No single company, industry or \ngovernment agency can tackle these \nissues alone. \n\nMaking Financial  \nProducts and Services \nMore Inclusive\n\nCiti is working to expand access to safe \nand affordable products and services \nwithin low-income communities and \ncommunities of color, where a lack of \naccess to financial products and services \ncan leave families financially vulnerable. \nWe harness our global infrastructure \nand the deep expertise of our colleagues \nand collaborate with other institutions to \nunderstand the challenges of our clients \nand create scalable, responsible and \ncommercially viable solutions that expand \naccess and deliver greater inclusive \neconomic growth.  \n\nIn Mexico, where 63 percent of adults are \nunbanked and 80 percent of payments \nare made in cash, we\u2019re focused on \nbringing more residents into the formal \nbanking system. Through the launch of \nthe Cobro Digital market-wide initiative \n(or CoDi Payment, for short), Mexico is \nenabling more than 5.5 million digital \nclients to send collection requests and \npayments of up to 8,000 pesos ($400 \nUSD) by using QR codes and near-field \ncommunication (NFC) on their phones \nat no cost. Citibanamex is one of the \nleading banks in the initiative and has \nhad a leadership role since inception. \nCoDi will redefine the way charges and \npayments are made in Mexico, allowing \nmonetary transactions to be made more \nefficiently and securely. The new platform \n\nworks with all smartphones, banks and \ntelephone carriers. \n\nIn the U.S., we have established relation-\nships with 28 minority-owned depository \ninstitutions, community banks and credit \nunions as part of our Citi ATM Community \nNetwork, a pilot program we started in \nJuly 2016.

In some \ninstances, when customers may need \nspecial assistance, we provide support to \naddress their needs. For example, during \nthe U.S. federal government shutdown \nthat ended in early 2019, Citi offered a \nrange of assistance measures for custom-\ners experiencing financial hardship as a \nresult of the shutdown, including fee and \ninterest adjustments, minimum payment \n\ndeferrals and forbearance programs. Late \nin 2019, we provided a suite of disaster \nrelief packages to customers impacted by \nAustralia\u2019s bushfires, including a payment \nmoratorium with a suspension of repay-\nment and no interest or fee charges. \n\nWe also partner with community orga-\nnizations to build financial capability \nfor individuals and communities. In the \nU.S. in 2019, Citi collaborated with more \nthan 20 municipalities and counties, as \nwell as leading nonprofit organizations, \nto support free tax preparation services \nand address the billions of dollars in \nunclaimed Earned Income Tax Credits \n(EITCs) left on the table by millions of \nlower-income working households annu-\nally.

Yet according to the \nInternal Revenue Service, one out of \nevery five eligible households does not \nclaim the EITC and, of those who do file, \nmany pay hundreds of dollars to file their \ntaxes when there are free, professional \nfiling services available to them. \n\nCiti provided approximately $4.5 million \ntoward 2018 and 2019 tax time initiatives. \nIn 2019, Citi\u2019s investments had widespread \npositive impact, especially across the \nstate of California, where Citi-supported \ntax preparation campaigns and services \nhelped 29,500 eligible filers complete \ntheir EITC forms, which yielded over \n$58.5 million in tax credits claimed. These \nfree tax preparation services helped filers \nsave an estimated $6.8 million in tax \npreparation fees.\n\nAlso in 2019, Citi announced the expansion \nof Empowered Cities, a landmark initiative \ndesigned to advance financial inclusion \nand economic opportunity for people \nwith disabilities, many of whom live on \nlower incomes. Citi\u2019s $2 million commit-\nment will expand the initiative to Boston, \nChicago, Los Angeles and San Francisco, \nbuilding on the existing partnership with \nthe City of New York and the National \nDisability Institute. Empowered Cities is \nalso expanding the initiative\u2019s areas of \nfocus to include housing and employment \nfor financially vulnerable households in \nthe disability community. Individuals with \ndisabilities and their families are among \nthe most underserved and financially \nvulnerable groups in the country. There \nare 61 million people with a disability \nin the U.S., and more than a quarter of \nthem are living below the poverty line. \nThe national expansion builds on the first \nmunicipal model, EmpoweredNYC, which \nlaunched in early 2018 with an initial       \n$2 million seed investment from Citi. Led \nby the NYC Department of Consumer and \nWorker Protection\u2019s Office of Financial \nEmpowerment, EmpoweredNYC has deliv-\nered more than 1,100 specialized financial \ncounseling sessions to nearly 700 New \n\nCiti 2019 ESG Report\f##PAGE_BREAK##Yorkers with disabilities and their families. \nIn 2019, we participated in a convening of \ncommissioners from 10 mayoral offices \nand disabilities-focused leaders to explore \nhow we can address the most pressing \nfinancial security issues facing the disabil-\nity community.\n\nIn addition, we work with several \nmunicipal and community partners to \nprovide immigrants with knowledge and \nresources to strengthen their financial \ncapabilities. Many Mexican immigrants \nin the U.S., for example, are not familiar \nwith the country\u2019s complex financial \nand tax environment and face real or \nperceived obstacles rooted in language, \nculture and barriers to trust. The \nVentanilla de Asesor\u00eda Financiera (VAF) \nprogram operates on-site at Mexican \nconsulates and offers in-language guid-\nance on opening a bank account, budget-\ning, paying off debt, gaining access to \nfree tax preparation, establishing credit \nand building a secure financial future. Citi \nprovided seed funding to create and scale \nthis model and has collaborated with the \nForeign Ministry of Mexico to expand it \nto 48 consulates across the country. Of \nthe 48 VAFs operating in the consular \noffices of Mexico in the U.S., Citi directly \nfinances eight. In 2019, the VAF program \nwas featured at the first-ever summit for \nfinancial inclusion of Mexicans abroad, \nwhich was attended by key Mexican \ngovernment officials across finance, \neducation and foreign affairs. \n\nEmpowered Through \nEducation\n\nEducation is one of the best means for \nimproving one\u2019s financial situation. But \nhigh costs and other socioeconomic \nbarriers can put higher education out of \nreach for many, especially those who are \nunbanked or living on lower incomes. \n\nIn the U.S., where the rising cost of a \ncollege degree can prevent many from  \npursuing higher education and leave \nmany others saddled with significant \ndebt, Citi Start SavingSM aims to help. \nThe program launched in San Francisco, \n\nBrave Girl Rising is a short film presented by the nonprofit behind the global campaign for girls\u2019 \neducation and empowerment Girl Rising. The film follows a young refugee woman named Nasro \nwho sees education as her lifeline, yet who every day faces formidable challenges in accessing this \nfundamental human right. In telling her story, the film seeks to illuminate the plight facing millions of \nrefugee girls around the world and inspire action for girls\u2019 education and empowerment. Citi, which \nsupported the film with the International Rescue Committee and others, hosted over 160 screenings \nof the film when it premiered on March 8, 2019, on International Women\u2019s Day.\n\nwhere one in three children are born \ninto families with little to no savings. For \nmany of these children, a college savings \naccount could be their family\u2019s first expo-\nsure to mainstream financial services as \nwell as a pathway to opportunity. \n\nIn 2009, when then-Mayor Gavin \nNewsom put forward his vision for a \nuniversal children\u2019s savings program, Citi \nstepped up to the challenge. We worked \nwith the city, teachers and parents to \nunderstand the needs and challenges \nof establishing a savings program in \nwhich every child, even those whose \nparents may be unbanked and those \n\nwho are foster children, is included. \nThe result was Kindergarten to College \n(K2C), the nation\u2019s first universal youth \nsavings account program, built on the \nfirst-of-its-kind Citi Start Saving platform. \nA K2C account contains an initial $50 \nincentive for every child who enters the \ncity\u2019s public school system. Additional \nincentives are awarded over time for \nmaking deposits or for positive behaviors \nin school.\n\nA new update to Citi Start Saving that \nwas deployed in 2019 provides five \ndifferent automated channels for taking \ndeposits and automatically processes \n\n39\n\n\f##PAGE_BREAK##Contents \n\n  Our Approach to ESG \n\n  Solutions for Impact \n\n  How We Do Business \n\n  Appendices             \n\n\u201cE for Education\u201d \nIn 2013, we created our \u201ce for education\u201d campaign to raise awareness and funds for  \neducation-focused nonprofits that tackle childhood illiteracy and improve access to \nquality education. During the annual campaign, Citi\u2019s Foreign Exchange business  \ndonates $1 for every $1 million traded on our platforms. The initiative, which also  \nincluded local market bonds, expanded across Futures and Cash Equities for the first \ntime in 2019.

These updates help families have \ngreater control over their financial \nresources and immediately see how daily \nactivity impacts their overall position. \nParticipants and their families can \naccess information on their program \nand accounts 24/7 from a desktop, \nsmartphone or tablet. In September, \nCiti Start Saving enabled about 11,000 \nSan Francisco public school students, \nincluding 5,000 kindergarteners, to kick \noff the new school year with this powerful \nnew tool for achieving future success and \nsaving for their education.\n\nWe have made this platform available \nto any municipality that wants to start \na child savings account (CSA) program. \nResearch has shown that even a small \namount of college savings can help build \naspirations and encourage young people \nto view a college education as attainable. \nWe recognize, however, that creating \naspiration is not enough. We know that \nsteps need to be taken to address the \nsystemic roadblocks to higher educa-\ntion, especially for low-income families. \nUniversal access to youth savings \naccounts is but one tool that can help \nadvance that goal.\n\nThe Future of Work\n\nThe youth unemployment rate is \nthree times higher than that of adults. \nAllowing economically disadvantaged \nyoung people to turn into economically \ndisadvantaged adults contributes to a \ndestructive cycle that hinders the growth \nof communities, cities and economies. Citi \nand the private sector as a whole have a \nrole to play in helping to make the next \ngeneration the most employable yet. And \npublic\u2013private partnerships are among \nthe most effective ways to reach low- \nincome communities at scale and drive \npositive social and economic gains. \n\nThrough the Pathways to Progress initia-\ntive, Citi and the Citi Foundation help to \ndeliver on SDG target 8.6, which aims \nto substantially reduce, by 2020, the \nproportion of youth not in employment, \neducation or training. \n\nSDG Goal 8: Decent Work and Economic \nGrowth \n\nPathways to Progress\n\nThe Citi Foundation\u2019s Pathways to \nProgress initiative is designed to help \nclose the job-skills mismatch by providing \nyoung people with the tools they need \nthrough training, work experience and \nentrepreneurial opportunities. \n\nSince 2014, the Citi Foundation has \ninvested more than $194 million to impact \n\nthe lives of youth globally. As we look \nahead, we remain committed to tackling \nthe youth unemployment challenge. \nThe Citi Foundation will reaffirm its \nphilanthropic commitment, and we will \ncomplement these investments with \nyouth-focused efforts happening across \nCiti, including programs that are helping \nus build a more diverse talent pipeline \nwhile also preparing the next generation \nfor today\u2019s workforce. \n\nIt is important for us to share the valu-\nable lessons that have informed the \nFoundation\u2019s programming and shaped \nthe evolution of this commitment. We \nbelieved then and continue to believe now \nthat empowering young people, providing \nearly work experience and financial \nknowledge, incubating an entrepreneurial \nmindset, creating networks and access \nto role models, and driving systemic \nand structural changes to the field of \nwork are each integral to helping the \nnext generation build stronger futures \nfor themselves, their families and their \ncommunities.

We also champion climate-positive activities more \nbroadly. In 2019 alone, we became: \n\n \u2022 A signatory to the Principles for Responsible Banking, a set of principles that provide a \n\nframework to achieve a sustainable banking system.\n\n \u2022 A signatory to the joint labor union and CEO \u201cUnited for Paris Agreement,\u201d reinforcing \n\nour commitment and support for the international plan to address climate change \nand accelerate the actions and investments needed for a sustainable future; this \nstatement built on the \u201cWe Are Still In\u201d declaration we signed in 2018 as part of our \nongoing support for the Paris Agreement. \n\n \u2022 A signatory to the Guiding Principles for Federal Action on Climate, which set out \n\nprinciples for long-term federal policy on climate change in the U.S. \n\nCompleting Our \n$100B Environmental \nFinance Goal\n\nEnvironmental finance was one of the \npillars of our five-year Sustainable \nProgress Strategy, which concluded in \n2019.1 The $100 Billion Environmental \nFinance Goal was the strategy\u2019s flagship \ninitiative. Due to increasing and innova-\ntive environmental finance activity in the \nglobal market, we were able to reach the \n$100 billion mark in the second quarter of \n2019 and counted a total of $164 billion \nby year\u2019s end. In 2019, several key invest-\nment banking transactions related to \nrenewable energy financing and mergers \nand acquisitions contributed significant \nleague table credit2 to the goal.\n\nThe marketplace has matured since we \nlaunched the $100 billion goal, which \nfollowed a previous $50 billion goal \nthat we completed in 2013. Many of the \nproducts available today \u2014 such as green \nbonds and loans, hedging for renewable \nenergy projects and lending linked to \nenvironmental, social and governance \n(ESG) performance \u2014 were relatively new \nor even nonexistent just a few years ago. \nThe increasing focus on environmental \nfinance is due to growing efforts by \ncompanies and other organizations to \nestablish sustainability targets and the \nnew and innovative products to help them \nachieve these goals, with an increased \nrecognition of the urgency of the climate \nchallenge and the need for solutions. To \nmeet these needs, we help our clients \nachieve their goals in support of a \nsustainable global economy. \n\nOur $100 billion goal directly supported \nour mission to provide financial services \nthat enable growth and economic prog-\nress. Each transaction needed to meet \nat least one of six criteria in order to be \ncounted: renewable energy, water quality \nand conservation, sustainable transporta-\ntion, green building, energy efficiency or \nclean technology. The activities that met \nthese criteria covered a diverse range of \nproducts and services, such as project \nand infrastructure financing, green \nbonds, power purchase agreements and \ntax equity financing, to name a few.\n\nThe environmental finance projects that \ncounted toward the goal were all core \nbanking activities financed and facilitated \nin partnership with Citi clients. While \nthey certainly added to our own bottom \nline, their value and benefits extended \nto many stakeholders, local communities \nand the broader global economy.\n\nLeader in Sustainable Finance \nIn 2019, Citi was ranked second in  \nDealogic\u2019s Corporate Green, Social & \nSustainable Bonds League Table. We were \nalso ranked second in the industry for our \nmunicipal finance activity, which includes \ngreen bonds, by the Thomson Reuters SDC \nLeague Table, and fourth on Bloomberg\u2019s \nGlobal Green Bonds (Corporates & Gov-\nernments) League Table. Additionally, we \nranked third for Tax Equity by Bloomberg \nNew Energy Finance.\n\n1  For performance against our Sustainable Progress Strategy Scorecard, please see the report Appendices. \n2  A league table is a competitive ranking of banks, companies, industries, geographies or other groups of entities ordered according to a metric (e.g., deal volume, number of deals).\n\n44\n\nCiti 2019 ESG Report\f##PAGE_BREAK##$100 Billion \nEnvironmental \nFinance Goal: \n\nFinancial Highlights, \n2014\u20132019*\n\nA total of\n\n$164B\n\nresulted in:\n\n$8.4B\n\nin sustainable \ntransportation\n\n$122.1B\n\nin renewable energy\n\n$22.1B\n\nin public finance\n\n$24.3B\n\nin green bonds**\n\n$4.6B\n\nin green building\n\n$13.1B\n\nin water quality and \nconservation\n\n* Transactions fall within multiple categories of reporting.\n**  Includes the green portion of sustainability bonds when \n\ninformation is available.\n\nEnvironmental Finance in Support of the SDGs\nAccording to a recent report,3 an estimated $90 trillion of investments in climate  \nprojects will be needed by 2030 to combat climate change and achieve the UN  \nSustainable Development Goals. In addition, global green finance must reach  \n$1 trillion by the end of 2020, growing each year thereafter. \n\nMuch of the work that we counted toward our $100 Billion Environmental Finance \nGoal was most aligned with three of the SDGs: SDG 7, which seeks to ensure access \nto affordable, reliable, sustainable and modern energy for all; SDG 11, which aims \nto make cities and human settlements inclusive, safe, resilient and sustainable; \nand SDG 13, which contributes to urgent action to combat climate change and its \nimpacts. \n\nFor example, target 7.2, to increase the share of renewable energy in the global \nenergy mix by 2030, and target 7.3, to double the global rate of energy efficiency \nimprovements by 2030, were both aligned with the objectives of our $100 billion \ngoal. The total financing of renewable energy and energy efficiency projects account-\ned for $122.1 billion and $1.3 billion, respectively. \n\nThe $100 billion goal also contributed to SDG target 11.2 \u2014 which aims to provide \naccess to safe, affordable, accessible and sustainable transport systems for all \n\u2014 thanks to our investments in sustainable transit, another of the key criteria of our \ngoal. Financing for sustainable transit projects contributed a cumulative $8.4 billion \ntoward our goal. \n\nWhile SDG 13 is focused on the wider response to a changing climate, several of our \ninvestments, including municipal bond underwriting and activities supporting water \nquality and conservation projects, delivered on SDG target 13.1, which aims in part to \nstrengthen resilience and adaptive capacity to climate-related hazards. \n\nSDG GOAL 7: Affordable and Clean Energy \n\n \nSDG GOAL 11: Sustainable Cities and Communities \n\n \n\nSDG GOAL 13: Climate Action \n\n3     Climate Bonds Initiative, Bonds and Climate Change: The State of the Market 2018 (September 2018). \n\n45\n\n\f##PAGE_BREAK##Contents \n\n  Our Approach to ESG \n\n  Solutions for Impact \n\n  How We Do Business \n\n  Appendices             \n\nHow We Reached  \nOur Goal\n\nTo reach our goal, Citi drew on the \ndiverse expertise of our global banking \nteams to provide our clients with innova-\ntive products and services that finance \nsolutions to address climate challenges.\n\nTo track transactions and calculate \ntheir contribution toward the goal, we \nused third-party financial sector league \ntable data, which was developed to rank \nfinancial institutions based on their role in \neach transaction and overall activity in the \nmarket. This is aligned with the sector\u2019s \nmethod for measuring credit received \nfor business activity. Our methodology is \npublicly available on our website.\n\nFor the majority of the financial activity \ncounted toward the goal, we used league \ntable accounting credit from Dealogic, \nThomson Reuters and Bloomberg New \nEnergy Finance. For loans or other \nfinancial products for which there are no \nestablished league tables, we counted \nthe amount that reflects Citi\u2019s financial \ninvolvement in the deal.\n\nOur Sustainability & ESG team worked \nclosely with contributing business units \nto track progress toward our $100 billion \ngoal in the following business catego-\nries: Alternative Energy Banking and \nFinancing, Green Bonds, Public Finance, \nCommodities, and Consumer Banking and \nCommercial Banking. \n\nThe World\u2019s First SDG-Linked Bond\n\nIn 2019, the Italian utility Enel, a leader in the renewable energy space with \nan ambitious decarbonization strategy, launched the world\u2019s first general \npurpose bond linked to the Sustainable Development Goals. This transaction \nis significant as the first general corporate purposes bond to be linked to \nsustainability performance indicators. Citi acted as joint active bookrunner \non the $1.5 billion U.S. bond issue, which offers a unique coupon step-up \nfeature: a one-time interest rate step-up of +25 basis points triggered if the \nrenewable installed energy capacity target of 55 percent is not met by the \nend of 2021.\n\nAfter the inaugural issuance, Enel launched another SDG-linked bond in the \nEuropean market, raising \u20ac2.5 billion across three tranches. The transaction \nwas almost four times oversubscribed, with total orders of about \u20ac10 billion. \nThe short-dated tranches of four and seven years followed a similar struc-\nture as the USD bond; however, the coupon on the long-dated 15 year was \nlinked to Enel achieving greenhouse gas emissions by 2030 equal to or less \nthan 125 grams of carbon dioxide (CO2) per kilowatt hour, also incorporating \na +25 basis point step-up mechanism if the target is not reached. These \nsustainability KPI-linked bond issuances have set a new precedent in the \ninternational bond market, and we expect several other issuers to adopt this \nstructure in 2020.\n\nContributing \nBusinesses\n\nAlternative Energy  \nBanking and Financing\n\nCiti provides a full range of financing \nsolutions for environmental projects \nglobally, and we continue to develop \ninnovative, end-to-end solutions to meet \nour clients\u2019 unique financing needs. Our \nAlternative Energy Banking and Financing \nteams have developed extensive exper-\ntise in financing solutions for a broad \nspectrum of renewable energy technol-\nogies, including wind, solar, geothermal \nand biomass. For larger, utility-scale \nprojects, we are able to provide multiple \nservices as a one-stop shop for our \nclients, including construction financing, \ncommodities hedging and tax equity on a \nsingle deal. Citi\u2019s approach to alternative \nenergy and banking products has sparked \nincreased client demand for across-the-\nboard financing solutions. \n\nCase Study: A Financing Solution for \nNextEra Energy Partners and KKR\n\nCiti structured a convertible equity \nportfolio financing solution for NextEra \nEnergy Partners (NEP) and KKR & Co., a \nleading global investment firm, to fund \nrenewable development in a unique \nstructure that met the objectives of both \nclients. Under the agreement, KKR will \nacquire an equity interest in a structured \npartnership with NEP, which owns a \ndiverse portfolio of 10 wind and solar \nprojects in nine U.S. states, collectively \nconsisting of more than 1,100 megawatts \n(mw).\n\nCiti was one of the leads on the financing \nof this complex, multilayered deal, which \nfeatured an innovative structure with a \nunique buyout option for NEP. The financ-\ning included a funded term loan, delayed-\ndraw term loan and equity margin loan. \n\n46\n\nCiti 2019 ESG Report\f##PAGE_BREAK##Green, Social and  \nSustainability Bonds\n\nCiti was one of the largest underwriters \nof green, social and sustainability bonds \nglobally in 2019. These transactions \nhelped our clients raise more than  \n$7.8 billion to meet their environmental, \nsocial and overall sustainability goals. \n\nCiti co-founded the Green Bond \nPrinciples, which provide issuers with \nguidelines encouraging transparency, \nand we are an active member of its \nSocial Bond Working Group and the \nWorking Group on Climate Transition \nFinance. Through these working groups, \nwe continue to contribute to the further \ndevelopment of the social and sustain-\nable bond market and look to provide \nfurther guidance for the emerging \nclimate transition bond market.\n\nIn early 2019, Citi expanded our leader-\nship role in green bonds and sustainable \nfinancing. We have evolved from one \nof the co-authors of the Green Bond \nPrinciples to underwriter and now to \nissuer with our inaugural green bond: \na \u20ac1 billion, three-year, fixed-rate green \nbond. Through March 2019, Citi issued  \na total of approximately $1.3 billion \nequivalent in green bonds, including \n$143 million equivalent across  \n18 transactions through the structured \nnotes channel. The proceeds of the \ngreen bonds will fund renewable energy, \nsustainable transportation, water quality \nand conservation, energy efficiency \nand green building projects. These \ngreen bond issuances are an important \nmilestone for Citi and demonstrate our \ncommitment to being a leader in financ-\ning sustainable global growth and prog-\nress. They also illustrate Citi\u2019s ability to \nscale sustainable solutions, respond to \nfast-growing investor demand and drive \nglobal impact in partnerships with our \nclients. \n\nCase Study: Underwriting  \na Green Bond \n\nCase Study: Supporting a Greener \nBuilding Product\n\nIn 2019, Citi acted as a joint lead manager \non a $2 billion, 10-year green bond for \nKfW, the flagship promotional bank of the \nFederal Republic of Germany. The bond \nmarks the largest USD green bond ever \nissued by any sovereign, supranational \nand agency (SSA) issuer. The orderbook \ncomprised 120 individual investors, \nclosed in excess of $4.8 billion, and was \nunderscored with strong support from \ngreen-motivated investors, who made \nup 58 percent of allocation. This was \nKfW\u2019s first USD-denominated green \nbond following the update of their Green \nBond Framework in May 2019 to include \nfunding for energy efficiency projects. \nProceeds from the bond will finance new \neligible green projects within the catego-\nries of renewable energy (including the \nconstruction, expansion and acquisition \nof plants generating power or heat from \nrenewable energy sources) and energy \nefficiency (including the construction \nof new energy-efficient residential \nbuildings).\n\nPublic Finance \n\nNational and subnational governments \nare often on the front lines in responding \nto climate change, and Citi provides \nfinancial solutions, including loans and \nbonds, to help them invest in clean water, \ntransportation and energy infrastructure \nto meet the needs of their citizens.\n\nCiti\u2019s community lending and investing \nactivity also includes financing of \naffordable housing and LEED-certified \naffordable housing projects that were \ncounted toward our $100 billion goal. \nThe affordable housing activity counted \nacross the six years of the goal served \nnearly 6,800 families. \n\nCiti helped to finance construction \nof the manufacturing plant for the \nworld\u2019s first commercial-scale producer \nof medium density fiberboard (MDF) \nmade from post-harvest rice straw. \nOnce complete, CalPlant will be able to \nsupply approximately 140 million square \nfeet of sustainable high-performance \nno-added-formaldehyde MDF to the \nbuilding products industry. In 2019, Citi \nfinanced $74 million of subordinate lien \nbonds that were certified \u201cgreen,\u201d given \nthe project\u2019s environmental aspects. \nThese follow $228 million in green \nbonds Citi financed for CalPlant in 2017. \n\nCalPlant\u2019s predecessor company, CalAg, \nLLC, spent over 20 years developing and \npatenting a process to make sustainable \nhigh-performance MDF using annually \nrenewable post-harvest rice straw as the \nfeedstock. California\u2019s Sacramento Valley \nis home to approximately 500,000 acres \nof rice annually. Rice straw, which has \nposed environmental issues in California \nfor more than a century, is an agricul-\ntural waste product of the annual rice \nharvest.\n\nHistorically, each year farmers would \ndispose of rice straw by burning the \nstraw. The burning of rice straw produces \nvarious pollutants, which impacted the \nair quality of California\u2019s Central Valley \nduring the straw burning season. More \nrecently, the straw has been disposed \nof by flooding the fields after harvest, \ninitiating a decomposition process. This \npractice uses a large volume of water \nand generates one-half to one ton of \nmethane gas per acre of planted rice \nfrom the rotting straw. By processing the \nstraw into MDF, CalPlant will significantly \nreduce the amount of water that might \notherwise be diverted from regional \nwaterways to flood the fields, and, will \nimprove air quality by less straw being \ndecomposed in the flooded fields. \nSacramento Valley rice growers within  \n15 to 25 miles of the plant site are provid-\ning the straw used at the plant. \n\n47\n\n\f##PAGE_BREAK##Citi 2019 ESG Report\n\nContents \n\n  Our Approach to ESG \n\n  Solutions for Impact \n\n  How We Do Business \n\n  Appendices             \n\nOur $100B Environmental Finance Goal Results\n\nTo achieve our goal, we used our environmental criteria to review activity \nfinanced and facilitated in partnership with our clients:\n\nRenewable  \nEnergy\n\nWater Quality and \nConservation\n\nSustainable \nTransportation\n\nGreen \nBuilding\n\nEnergy \nEfficiency\n\nClean \nTechnology\n\nWe identified activity that counted toward the goal, such as the examples  \nlisted below:\n\nAlternative energy banking \nand finance\n\u2022  Wind energy project financing\n\u2022  Solar company IPO\n \nGreen bonds\n\u2022  Corporate green bond\n\u2022  Sovereign green bond\n\nPublic finance\n\u2022  Wind energy power transit bond\n\u2022   LEED-certified affordable housing  \n\nloan\n\n \nCommodities\n\u2022  Power purchase agreement\n\u2022  Monetization of renewable energy credits\n\nConsumer/commercial banking\n\u2022  Solar company corporate loan\n\nWe financed environmental solutions around the world:\n\n$61.7B\n\nNorth America\n\n$4.7B\n\nMultiple \nRegions\n\n$2.2B\n\nLatin America\n\n$88.9B\n\nEurope, Middle \nEast and Africa\n\n$164B\n\nTotal\n\n$6.5B\n\nAsia Pacific\n\nThese solutions resulted in measurable impacts:\n\n11.8M mt CO2e\n\navoided emissions\n\n198K\n\njobs supported  \n(direct, indirect and \ninduced)\n\n95M\n\npopulation in U.S. \ncities and counties \nserved by water-\nquality projects\n\n6,792\n\nfamilies served by \ngreen affordable \nhousing\n\n6,869 MW\n\nnew renewable energy \ncapacity\n\n48\n\n\f##PAGE_BREAK##$100 Billion Environmental Finance Goal\n\nFinancial Data* \n\nIn billions USD, 2014\u20142019\n\nEnvironmental Criteria\n\n2014\n\nRenewables\n\nSolar\n\nWind\n\nMixed Renewables\n\nEnergy Efficiency\n\nGreen Building\n\n Sustainable \nTransportation\n\n Water Quality and \nConservation\n\nClean Technology\n\nMultiple Criteria\n\nTotal\n\nRegion\n\nNorth America\n\n Europe, Middle East and \nAfrica\n\nAsia Pacific\n\nLatin America\n\nMultiple Regions\n\nTotal\n\nBusiness\n\n Alternative Energy \nBanking and Finance\n\nGreen Bonds**\n\nPublic Finance\n\nCommodities\n\n Consumer Banking and \nCommercial Banking\n\nTotal\n\n4.9\n\n0.8\n\n3.0\n\n1.1\n\n0.1\n\n0.4\n\n0.5\n\n0.4\n\n0.1\n\n1.1\n\n7.5\n\n4.2\n\n2.4\n\n0.2\n\n0.2\n\n0.5\n\n7.5\n\n4.2\n\n1.8\n\n0.7\n\n0.2\n\n0.6\n\n7.5\n\n2015\n\n11.6\n\n2.1\n\n7.9\n\n1.6\n\n0.3\n\n0.6\n\n1.8\n\n1.2\n\n0.1\n\n1.4\n\n2016\n\n9.6\n\n0.6\n\n8.6\n\n0.4\n\n0.3\n\n0.7\n\n1.6\n\n2.8\n\n0.1\n\n0.5\n\n2017\n\n10.9\n\n4.9\n\n4.4\n\n1.6\n\n0.1\n\n0.3\n\n1.2\n\n1.4\n\n0.0\n\n2.9\n\n2018\n\n24.3\n\n1.6\n\n7.4\n\n15.3\n\n0.0\n\n2.2\n\n1.6\n\n5.3\n\n0.0\n\n5.1\n\n2019\n\n60.8\n\n1.5\n\n1.1\n\n58.1\n\n0.4\n\n0.4\n\n1.7\n\n2.0\n\n0.0\n\n3.2\n\nTotal $\n\nTotal %\n\n122.1\n\n11.5\n\n32.5\n\n78.1\n\n1.3\n\n4.6\n\n8.4\n\n13.1\n\n0.4\n\n14.2\n\n74%\n\n7%\n\n20%\n\n48%\n\n1%\n\n3%\n\n5%\n\n8%\n\n0%\n\n9%\n\n16.9\n\n15.6\n\n16.9\n\n38.6\n\n68.6\n\n164.0\n\n100%\n\n11.2\n\n4.1\n\n0.1\n\n0.5\n\n1.1\n\n6.7\n\n7.8\n\n0.5\n\n0.1\n\n0.5\n\n7.4\n\n6.7\n\n2.3\n\n0.4\n\n-\n\n24.7\n\n7.4\n\n61.7\n\n9.5\n\n2.0\n\n0.4\n\n1.9\n\n58.5\n\n88.9\n\n1.3\n\n0.7\n\n0.6\n\n6.5\n\n2.2\n\n4.7\n\n38%\n\n54%\n\n4%\n\n1%\n\n3%\n\n16.9\n\n15.6\n\n16.9\n\n38.6\n\n68.6\n\n164.0\n\n100%\n\n11.0\n\n1.8\n\n3.2\n\n0.5\n\n0.5\n\n9.0\n\n1.4\n\n4.3\n\n0.5\n\n0.4\n\n9.2\n\n4.4\n\n2.9\n\n0.2\n\n0.2\n\n24.1\n\n56.7\n\n114.3\n\n70%\n\n7.0\n\n7.3\n\n0.0\n\n0.1\n\n7.9\n\n3.6\n\n0.2\n\n0.1\n\n24.3\n\n22.1\n\n1.6\n\n1.8\n\n15%\n\n13%\n\n1%\n\n1%\n\n16.9\n\n15.6\n\n16.9\n\n38.6\n\n68.6\n\n164.0\n\n100%\n\n*  Figures may not sum to totals due to rounding.\n**   Includes the green portion of sustainability bonds when information is available.\n\n49\n\n\f##PAGE_BREAK##Contents \n\n  Our Approach to ESG \n\n  Solutions for Impact \n\n  How We Do Business \n\n  Appendices             \n\nCommodities\n\nCitigroup Energy Inc. (CEI) \u2014 Citi\u2019s \nCommodities team and energy trading \ndesk \u2014 provides hedges for renewable \nenergy project financing deals, helps \nclients obtain renewable energy credits \nand works on commodities derivatives. \nThese services help enable our clients to \nachieve their financial and environmental \ngoals for renewable energy procurement. \nCEI has also played a role in helping Citi \nmeet our goal to power our facilities with \n100 percent renewable energy by 2020. \n\nCase Study: Sourcing Renewable Power\n\nQTS Realty Trust, a leading provider of \ndata centers, signed a 10-year agreement \nto purchase renewable energy to power \n100 percent of its electricity needs for \nits facilities in Chicago and Piscataway, \nNew Jersey. With support from CEI, the \ncompany has also achieved 100 percent \nrenewable energy status for its Irving, \nTexas, data center and plans to expand \nrenewable power initiatives in existing \nand new data centers. In addition to wind \npower, the Piscataway data center also \nfeatures a 14 mw solar farm that supplies \nenergy.\n\nEnvironmental and \nSocial Impacts \nAchieved Through  \nOur $100 Billion Goal\n\nWe recognize that the real-world impacts \nof our financing and lending activities \nare a crucial measure of success, and \nthis certainly applies to the $100 Billion \nEnvironmental Finance Goal. The impacts \nof this goal go much further than just the \ndollar amount of our direct financing. \n\nWhen we first developed our goal, we \nfelt it was important to try to measure \nand understand the impact \u2014 for our \nclients and the communities where we \ndo business. Using stakeholder feedback, \n\n4    EPA GHG Equivalencies Calculator, March 2020\n\n50\n\nCiti financed a U.S. wind and solar project owned by NextEra Energy Partners and KKR.\n\nwe identified a range of impacts \u2014 green-\nhouse gas (GHG) emissions avoided, \njobs supported and community benefits \nrealized \u2014 that we are able to calculate \nfor a subset of the transactions counted \ntoward the goal. As there is no estab-\nlished standard way to measure these \nimpacts, we developed our approach \nfollowing extensive research on a variety \nof best practices. We utilize actual project \ndata or apply a reasonable proxy if \napplicable.\n\nThis area of work proved to be an \nongoing education for us, where we \nlearned as we went and consistently \nchallenged ourselves to dig deeper. We \nrefined our methodology over the last \nseveral years to better understand the \nimpacts associated with the activity that \ncounts toward our goal. Overall, we took \na conservative approach to reporting \nimpacts and did not include deals in \nwhich we have limited transparency \non transaction details. Our impact \nmeasurement methodologies align with \nour accounting approach, reporting our \nshare of the impacts proportional to our \nfinancial share of the transaction. \n\nTo calculate environmental impacts, \nwe developed models to estimate the \navoided GHG emissions by a subset of \nthe transactions that contributed to the \n\n$100 billion goal \u2014 specifically, renewable \nenergy financing, energy efficiency \nfinancing and public finance. The esti-\nmated 11.8 million metric tons (mt) of \navoided GHG emissions as a result of our \nactivities throughout the duration of the \ngoal is the equivalent of removing more \nthan 2.5 million cars from the road for \none year.4 \n\nFor social impacts, our primary metric is \nthe number of jobs that are supported \nby a segment of the transactions count-\ning toward the goal, specifically Citi\u2019s \nfinancing of U.S.-based renewable energy \nprojects and public finance activity. We \ndeveloped a model, based on an approach \nused by economists and public policy \nexperts, that estimated our contribution \nto supporting U.S. jobs. These calcula-\ntions were based on specific investment \nand expenditure profiles tied to data \naggregated from a number of sources. \nSince 2014, we estimate that more than \n198,000 direct, indirect and induced \njobs were supported by the financing we \nprovide to our clients. \n\nWe also calculate our direct, indirect \nand induced impact on the U.S. gross \ndomestic product (GDP). We estimate that \nour 2018 and 2019 financing activities \ncontributed approximately $15.7 billion in \ntotal to U.S. GDP. \n\nCiti 2019 ESG Report\f##PAGE_BREAK##Impact Data*\n\nEnvironmental Impacts\n\n2014\n\n2015\n\n2016\n\n2017\n\n2018\n\n2019\n\nTotal\n\nAvoided GHG Emissions (mt)**\n\n1,360,092\n\n1,740,659\n\n325,676\n\n1,058,809\n\n4,410,701\n\n2,900,418 11,796,355\n\nRenewable Energy  \nProject Finance\n\nEnergy Efficiency  \nFinance\n\nPublic Finance\n\nConsumer/ \nCommercial Banking\n\nRenewable Energy Capacity \nAdded (MW)\n\n1,294,788\n\n1,590,612\n\n180,739\n\n1,057,022\n\n4,317,287 2,846,359 11,286,807\n\n60,061\n\n145,524\n\n140,149\n\n\u2013 \n\n91,199\n\n51,735\n\n488,667\n\n2,224\n\n1,672\n\n1,453\n\n1,246\n\n2,215\n\n2,324\n\n11,134\n\n3,019\n\n2,851\n\n3,335\n\n541\n\n\u2013\n\n\u2013\n\n9,746\n\n563\n\n869\n\n278\n\n619\n\n3,154\n\n1,386\n\n6,869\n\nSocial Impacts\n\n2014\n\n2015\n\n2016\n\n2017\n\n2018\n\n2019\n\nTotal\n\nJobs Supported***\n\n11,574\n\n29,494\n\n30,140\n\n22,995\n\n63,932\n\n39,965\n\n198,100\n\nRenewable Energy Project \nFinance\n\n4,870\n\n8,069\n\n4,378\n\n4,357\n\n9,603\n\n5,528\n\n36,805\n\nPublic Finance\n\n6,704\n\n21,425\n\n25,762\n\n18,638\n\n54,330\n\n34,437\n\n161,296\n\nPeople Serviced by Water \nQuality and Conservation \nProjects\n\nFamilies Serviced by \nAffordable Housing Activity\n\nTrips on Transit System \nProjects (in billions)\n\n211,346\n\n6,916,113 28,831,321\n\n7,617,037 12,363,540 39,476,656 95,416,013\n\n1,237\n\n1,004\n\n1,166\n\n1,340\n\n956\n\n1,089\n\n6,792\n\n\u2013\n\n3.5\n\n3.1\n\n4.2\n\n3.2\n\n4.2\n\n18.2\n\n* Figures may not sum to totals due to rounding.\n** 2018 Avoided GHG Emissions has been adjusted to reflect non baseload grid emissions factors consistent with previous reporting years.\n***  2018 amount of Jobs Supported is revised from previous reporting to accurately reflect our methodology.\n\n51\n\n\f##PAGE_BREAK##Contents \n\n  Our Approach to ESG \n\n  Solutions for Impact \n\n  How We Do Business \n\n  Appendices             \n\nTCFD and Climate Finance Opportunities\nCiti supports the Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures (TCFD) and its \nrecommendations for improved disclosure regarding the financial impacts of climate- \nrelated risks and opportunities.

ESRM was one of three key \npillars of our 2015 Sustainable Progress \nStrategy1 and will continue to be a core \ncomponent of our sustainability efforts \nmoving forward. \n\n1  For performance against our Sustainable Progress Strategy Scorecard, please see the report Appendices.\n\n54\n\nCiti 2019 ESG Report\f##PAGE_BREAK##being made. As a result, our client took \nresponsibility for the worker accommo-\ndations of their subcontractor and made \nimprovements to bring them up to the \nappropriate standards. \n\nIn some cases, we must decline to partic-\nipate in a transaction because we do not \nbelieve we can adequately address the \nenvironmental and social risks through \nmitigation measures or because the risks \nare too high. During 2019, for example, \nwe declined participation in an oil and \ngas exploration project in a biodiverse \ntropical rainforest due to a lack of free, \nprior and informed consent from affected \nindigenous communities, as well as \nimpacts to a critical habitat. We also \ndeclined a transaction for a hydroelectric \nproject in Southeast Asia because of \noverlap with critical habitat for endan-\ngered species. In addition, we declined a \nnumber of early financing opportunities \nrelated to coal-fired power in Latin \nAmerica and Asia based on the standards \nof our ESRM Policy commitment on coal-\nfired power. \n\nApplying our ESRM Policy helps us \nidentify risks beyond traditional credit \nrisks, guides how we evaluate transac-\ntions related to companies or projects \nwithin high-risk sectors and presents \nopportunities for us to advise clients \non solutions to thematic risks. To learn \nmore about our ESRM Policy, including \nAreas of High Caution, sector-specific \nstandards and policy prohibitions, see \nour Environmental and Social Policy \nFramework.\n\nOur ESRM Policy covers a broad scope \nof financial products and client sectors \nand sets standards for how we assess \nclient impacts on air quality, water \nquality, climate change, biodiversity, local \ncommunities, labor and other environ-\nmental and social issues. We established \nour comprehensive ESRM Policy in 2003 \n\u2014 the first U.S.-based financial institution \nto do so \u2014 and we continue to evolve our \napproach in response to emerging risks \nand new product development. \n\nPolicy Implementation\n\nOur centralized team of ESRM specialists \nwithin Citi\u2019s risk management function \nevaluates transactions that trigger a \nreview according to our ESRM Policy.2 We \nalso provide ESRM training to employees \nthroughout our organization globally, \nenabling them to spot potential risks. This \nnetwork approach enhances the global \ncoverage capacity of our centralized \nspecialist team. The ESRM team works \ncollaboratively and shares information \nand best practices during bimonthly calls \nthat help support and strengthen the \nentire network.\n\nOur ESRM team categorizes the project- \nrelated transactions they review as  \nA, B or C, with A indicating the highest \nrisk. The categorization is based on the \nmagnitude of potential adverse environ-\nmental and social impacts associated \nwith the project and is aligned with the \nEquator Principles (EP) and International \nFinance Corporation categorization. For \ngeneral corporate purposes transactions \nunder our ESRM Policy (categorized as \n\u201cgeneral review\u201d), we evaluate a client\u2019s \nenvironmental and social policies and \nperformance, as well as its commitment \nand capacity to manage environmental \nand social issues. Higher-risk, project- \nrelated transactions also receive in-depth \nreviews by independent environmental \nand social consultants. If gaps are found \nbetween a client\u2019s environmental and \n\nESRM Due Diligence in Action\nIn 2019, we identified environmental risks \nduring due diligence for two potential \nfinancings of industrial facilities in Mexico. \nOne of the planned facilities had the \npotential to negatively impact a critical \nmangrove habitat; the other was planned \nnear an internationally protected wetland \nsite where there were concerns about \neffluent drainage from the project into the \nwetlands. In both cases, we put financing \nconditions in place requiring the clients to \nengage biodiversity experts and develop \naction plans to avoid these environmental \nrisks. These conditions led to the develop-\nment of biodiversity management plans \nthat were implemented during the con-\nstruction of the facilities. Our ESRM Policy \nis most effective in cases like these, when \nwe are considering financing projects and \ncan include conditions requiring tangible \nactions to improve environmental and \nsocial outcomes.\n\nsocial plans, policies or practices and \ninternational standards, we develop an \nEnvironmental and Social Action Plan \n(ESAP) to fill the gaps. As a condition of \nfinancing, we require the client to imple-\nment the ESAP, and we monitor progress \nover time. \n\nWe also monitor the projects we finance \nto ensure the conditions of financing are \nbeing met. For instance, as part of our \nroutine monitoring of a financed manu-\nfacturing plant in Asia, we discovered that \nwhile our client\u2019s accommodations for \nconstruction workers met international \nstandards, some of their subcontractors\u2019 \naccommodations did not. We stepped in \nto ensure the conditions were improved \nto meet international standards for \ndecent living conditions and followed up \nregularly to confirm that progress was \n\n2    The ESRM section of our Environmental and Social Policy Framework outlines the scope of our ESRM Policy, including the types of transactions that trigger a review.\n\n55\n\n\f##PAGE_BREAK##Contents \n\n  Our Approach to ESG \n\n  Solutions for Impact \n\n  How We Do Business \n\n  Appendices             \n\nMonitoring the \nChanging Risk \nLandscape \n\nThe ESRM team uses a number of \nmethods to proactively scan the changing \nrisk landscape for new, emerging risks \nas well as risks with increased promi-\nnence and prevalence. Through internal \nresearch and third-party environmental \nand social data, we monitor relevant \ndevelopments in high-risk industries and \nstakeholder concerns to flag emerging \nissues. In recent years, for example, \nconcerns regarding e-cigarettes, opioids, \nprivate prisons and artificial intelligence \nhave become more prominent. Our \nongoing monitoring of these and other \nelevated concerns keeps us responsive to \n\nevolving risks, enabling us to raise aware-\nness within Citi about emerging issues \nand helping us identify clients that might \nbe impacted for further engagement. \nOur risk monitoring feeds into our ESRM \nWatchlist process, through which we flag \nindividual companies based on their track \nrecords, sensitive or controversial assets, \nthird-party sustainability scores and \nnegative news. \n\nESRM Champions\n\nOur ESRM Champions are credit risk \nofficers and other employees with \nregional expertise and additional ESRM \ntraining, who serve as bridges between \nour local banking teams and our global \nESRM team. They assist in training their \nlocal, internal teams about our ESRM \nPolicy, engage with regional regulators \n\nabout new financial regulatory guidance \nrelated to environmental and social risk \nand provide important regional insights \nthat improve our ability to make respon-\nsible lending decisions. For instance, \nin some countries that are developing \nor have recently adopted regulations \nrequiring banks to develop environmental \nand social risk policies and procedures \n\u2014 including Brazil, Ecuador, Honduras, \nParaguay and Peru \u2014 our ESRM \nChampions are helping us understand the \nlocal context so we can more effectively \nexecute due diligence processes and align \nour implementation.\n\nClient Engagement \n\nEngaging our clients is an important \npart of our ESRM due diligence process. \nInitially, these engagements were tied \n\nCollaborating to Update  \nthe Equator Principles \nSixteen years after co-founding the  \nEquator Principles (EP), Citi continues to \nhelp strengthen the Principles to ensure \nthey remain relevant. During 2019, we \ncontinued our participation in the EP up-\ndate process, helping to develop the most \nrecent iteration of this global standard \nfor banks evaluating environmental and \nsocial risks of project-related finance. \nThanks to an initiative co-led by Citi, EP \nnow encourages clients to share crucial \nbiodiversity data for all transactions \ncovered by the Principles. This transparen-\ncy helps to improve conservation efforts \naround the world. Citi also co-led the \nsocial risks working group, working hard \nto reach a consensus among all members \non strengthened requirements related to \npotential project impacts on human rights \nand Indigenous Peoples. The updated \nstandards, known as EP4, were released \nin November 2019 for implementation in \nJuly 2020. \n\n56\n\nAgribusiness Portfolio Review \n\nDeforestation is a key environmental concern globally, as it leads to habitat \nloss, biodiversity impacts and climate-related risks, among others. In 2019, we \nconducted a portfolio review of our agribusiness clients with a focus on the \nimpacts of deforestation. We developed a questionnaire to gather information \nabout how clients manage deforestation risks in their operations in the global \ntropics, including the tools they use to track deforestation and the certifica-\ntions they use to ensure sustainable practices and processes. \n\nWe found that one of the most effective ways to decrease deforestation risks \nis through quality sustainability certifications, such as the certification of \nplantations by the Roundtable on Sustainable Palm Oil, the Forest Stewardship \nCouncil and the Round Table on Responsible Soy. Some of the practices that \nthese certifications ensure include the preservation of high-conservation and \nhigh-carbon-stock forests, the restoration of forests cleared after 2009 and a \nprohibition on using fire to clear lands. \n\nOur clients\u2019 adoption of certifications in the areas of palm oil, forestry and soy \nin tropical countries has increased in recent years, as has the total area of \ntheir plantations certified. In addition, more companies are actively employing \nnew technologies that enable transparent traceability of their supply chains. \nThese are positive developments, and we are now analyzing the results of this \nportfolio review to inform continued improvement in our ESRM approach to \nthe agribusiness sector. \n\nCiti 2019 ESG Report\f##PAGE_BREAK##Partnership to Protect \nWorkers\u2019 Rights \n\nUlula is a mobile phone technology \nplatform that facilitates the report-\ning of worker welfare issues, the \nmonitoring of working conditions \nand employee engagement. In 2019, \nwe worked with Ulula to lay the \ngroundwork so that this tool  \ncould be deployed to address labor \nrights issues for a large infrastruc-\nture project in the Middle East \nbeginning in 2020. This technology \nhas great potential to safeguard the \nrights of migrant workers, enabling \nimmediate reporting of concerns \nusing mobile devices. Ulula has \nreached more than 1 million people \nin 22 countries to help advance \nworker and community engagement \nthrough their inclusive technology \nand real-time analytics across a \nbroad set of industries.\n\nto specific, project-related financial \ntransactions and their associated envi-\nronmental and social risks and mitigation \nefforts. However, as we have developed \nsector-specific standards over the years, \nwe have added corporate-level reviews \nand client engagements in a   number \nof sectors. These sector-specific risk \nreview processes encourage dialogue \nbetween Citi and our clients about the \nmaterial environmental and social risks \nassociated with their operations, enabling \nus to develop a better understanding \nof prevailing industry practices and our \nclients\u2019 performance.\n\nSome examples of client engagement \nactivities in 2019 include ESRM-focused \nsite visits in Colombia and Peru to \nmeet with clients in the oil, mining and \npalm oil industries. We learned how \none mining client was addressing and \nremediating legacy environmental lead \ncontamination and other environmental \nhealth concerns connected with one of \ntheir mines. Another mining company \ndemonstrated best practices in biodi-\nversity management by successfully \nrestoring a biodiversity corridor after \nmine decommissioning, which fostered \nthe reemergence of local flora and fauna, \nincluding jaguars. We also engaged with \n\na palm oil client that has shown impres-\nsive supply chain traceability through \ncertification of their smallholders to \nensure their supply chain is deforesta-\ntion free. These engagements help us \nlearn about emerging best practices for \nmanaging environmental and social risks \nthat can be shared with other clients \nfacing similar challenges. During 2019, \nwe also continued to engage clients in \nthe oil and gas industry on issues related \nto environmental, social and governance \nperformance and climate risk. \n\nEnhancing Our \nTraining\n\nEach year, we train key risk and banking \npersonnel on our ESRM Policy. Topics \ninclude environmental and social risks \nrelevant to certain regions and sectors, \nEP implementation and Citi\u2019s Sector \nStandards. The training also includes \nemerging risks and guidance to help \nemployees recognize environmental and \nsocial risk in transactions \u2014 ranging from \nclimate change risks to human rights \nrisks to labor concerns and more. In total, \nmore than 590 Citi employees underwent \nESRM training during 2019.\n\nPiloting a Policy Chat Bot \nDuring 2019, Citi piloted a new chat bot \nthat provides employees with information \nabout a broad range of issues covered by \nCiti\u2019s risk policies. Our ESRM function pro-\nvided input into the development of the \nchat bot related to the scope of our ESRM \nPolicy. The chat bot pilot is designed \nto test ways to make Citi policies more \naccessible to employees, and, in the case \nof the ESRM Policy, to help them better \ndetermine whether a specific transaction \nor client review requires engagement with \nthe ESRM team. \n\n57\n\n\f##PAGE_BREAK##Contents \n\n  Our Approach to ESG \n\n  Solutions for Impact \n\n  How We Do Business \n\n  Appendices             \n\nClimate-Related Risk\n\nClimate Risk Analysis\n\nClimate change is one of the most critical \nissues facing society today. Actions must \nbe taken to transition to a low-carbon \neconomy and address the climate-related \nrisks that are already being felt in many \nregions and industries to avoid the \nworst impacts of climate change. As a \nfinancier of the global economy, we are \nkeenly aware of the seriousness and \nurgency of climate change and how it \nmay affect the world. In response, we are \nassessing the impacts of climate change \non our portfolios, and then, informed \nby this deepened understanding, we are \nworking to enable the transition toward \na low-carbon economy. This section \ndelves into our risk-related activities. For \na broader overview of Citi\u2019s approach to \nclimate-related issues, see Citi\u2019s Support \nfor Climate Action.\n\nCiti\u2019s ESRM Policy sets a framework \nto assess the potential climate risks \nand impacts of the clients and projects \nthat we finance. Our project-related \nfinance approach aligns with the Equator \nPrinciples, including an alternatives anal-\nysis of less carbon-intensive technologies \nfor all transactions that exceed 100,000 \ntons of carbon dioxide emissions and a \nrisk assessment of negative impacts from \nphysical climate risk. \n\nOur ESRM Policy also includes Sector \nStandards that cover carbon-intensive \nsectors such as coal mining, coal-fired \npower, forestry, oil and gas and palm oil, \nthat have a greater impact on climate \nchange and are more exposed to climate \ntransition risks. With the help of our \ncross-functional Climate Risk Working \n\nAnalysis of Clean Energy Scenarios  \n\nIn 2019, Citi Global Perspectives and Solutions (Citi GPS) released its report \nEnergy Darwinism III: The Electrifying Path to Net Zero Carbon. The report \nnotes that significant reductions in future carbon dioxide emissions can be \nachieved through the electrification of transport and industry as we move \naway from fossil fuel use and toward clean energy alternatives. Using Citi\u2019s \nGlobal Integrated Energy & Emissions Framework it provides an analysis of \nlikely impacts if the global community maintains its current level of energy use \ncompared with the impacts and tradeoffs that could occur if we pursue differ-\nent energy use scenarios. \n\nIncreased electrification from clean energy poses undeniable risks for the fossil \nfuel industry. The Citi GPS report delves into the implications for the oil and \ngas and coal industries, showcasing the variables at play and the complexity \ninherent in charting a course forward. In relation to our own business, quanti-\nfying short-term and long-term risk for these industries remains a high priority \nas we manage our energy portfolio and reduce our exposure to industries that \ncarry significant risk. \n\nOf course, risk is only one side of the equation. The transition also creates \nnew opportunities. For more information about how Citi embraces investment \nopportunities related to clean energy and other sustainable solutions, see the \nEnvironmental Finance section. \n\nGroup, the ESRM team is developing \nmore comprehensive internal guidance \nto evaluate the climate risk of specific \nsectors for integration into the broader \nrisk analysis of clients. More information \nabout our ESRM Sector Standards are \navailable in our Environmental and Social \nPolicy Framework. \n\nClimate risk analysis methodologies, \ntools, data and scenarios continue to \nrapidly improve and advance. As the \nexpectations on banks to understand \ntheir portfolio-wide climate risk continue \nto increase, Citi is taking steps to further \nintegrate climate risk considerations \ninto our risk management approach \nbeyond the scope of the ESRM Policy. \nWe remain committed to participating \nin industry collaborations, monitoring \ndevelopments and experimenting with \ndifferent approaches to help us enhance \nour understanding and capacity for \naddressing climate-related risks and \nopportunities.\n\nFor a discussion of Citi\u2019s Task Force on \nClimate-related Financial Disclosures \n(TCFD) implementation, please see our \n2018 TCFD report, Finance for a Climate-\nResilient Future, and the Citi\u2019s Support for \nClimate Action section of this report.\n\nReducing Credit  \nExposure to Coal\n\nThe shift away from fossil fuels to \nrenewable energy will have a significant \neffect on both coal mining and coal-fired \npower production. Since 2015, Citi has \nhad a commitment to reduce our credit \nexposure to the coal mining industry \nand conduct enhanced due diligence on \nour coal mining clients\u2019 environmental \nand social policies and performance. \nThe effort applies globally to companies \ngenerating a majority of their revenues \nfrom coal mining activities and to coal- \nfocused subsidiaries of diversified mining \ncompanies. As a result of our commit-\nments and related activities, we have \nsuccessfully reduced our credit exposure \nin recent years. \n\n58\n\nCiti 2019 ESG Report\f##PAGE_BREAK##What\u2019s Ahead\n\nAddressing the risks associated with \nclimate change is a priority for Citi and \nfor our key stakeholders, including \nclients, investors and regulators. In an \neffort to better understand how the \ntransition and physical risks of climate \nchange may affect our business, our \nclients, our communities and the global \neconomy, we are continuing to explore \nnew methodologies and tools that \nassess and measure these risks \u2014 as well \nas potential opportunities. It is incum-\nbent upon all sectors to contribute to \nsolutions that limit warming to no more \nthan 2\u00b0C, with a goal of staying below \n1.5\u00b0C, above pre-industrial levels. As a \nresult, we expect that climate-related \nrisks and opportunities will be a growing \npriority for our clients in all sectors, not \njust for those in the fossil fuel and other \ntraditionally carbon-intensive industries. \nIn 2020 we will continue to test emerg-\ning climate risk assessment methodol-\nogies to better understand the climate \nrisk faced by Citi and our clients, and we \nwill continue to engage our clients on \nthe transition to a low-carbon economy. \n\nIn addition, 2020 will be a key year for \nbiodiversity and implementing the new \nEP4. As a leader in developing the guid-\nance note on Biodiversity Data Sharing \nfor EP4, Citi will be working with partners \nand other banks that have adopted the \nEquator Principles to raise awareness \nand train clients on how to share crit-\nical biodiversity data that is gathered \nduring project design and operational \nmonitoring.\n\nDuring 2019, we made progress imple-\nmenting our new ESRM Policy commitment \non coal-fired power, which prohibits any \nfinancing for the construction or expan-\nsion of coal-fired power plants. The restric-\ntion includes transactions supporting the \nsupply of all components, equipment, \nmaterials and services directly required \nfor the construction of such plants. The \nonly exception that may be considered is \nfor proposed ultra-supercritical plants that \naddress situations of energy poverty (i.e., \nin countries where the national electrifica-\ntion rate is 90 percent or below according \nto the annual Energy Progress Report) and \nalign with the host country\u2019s Nationally \nDetermined Contribution under the Paris \nAgreement. Since the implementation of \nthe policy, no transactions that we have \nreviewed have met this exception criteria. \nIn 2019, we declined five opportunities \nfor financing during the early stages of \nengagement as a result of this policy \nrestriction. \n\nIn support of our new commitments, we \nare reviewing our power-sector clients \nwith coal-fired generation to evaluate \ntheir greenhouse gas (GHG) tracking, \nreporting and reduction strategies and \ntheir management of risks and opportu-\nnities related to a low-carbon transition. \nWe want to understand how they are \nintegrating climate risk analysis into their \nbusiness strategy, if they have plans \nfor diversification away from coal-fired \npower sources and whether they are \ndeveloping low-carbon transition strat-\negies to align with the objectives of the \nParis Agreement. \n\nAs we help our clients transition away \nfrom coal, we consult external frame-\nworks and initiatives such as the Edison \nElectric Institute\u2019s environmental, social, \ngovernance and sustainability template \nand the Transition Pathway Initiative. \nWe also identify clients that have \ndemonstrated success in transitioning \naway from coal as well as clients that \nare experiencing challenges. Through \nengagement with diverse clients, we \nshare best practices and encourage open \ndialogue to support the energy transition. \n\nCross-Industry  \nCollaboration on  \nClimate Risk in  \nMaritime Shipping\n\nGHG emissions from the maritime ship-\nping industry are expected to increase \nover time to keep up with expanding \nglobal trade. As industries transition \nto low-carbon alternatives, maritime \nshipping will need to do the same or face \nsignificant financial risks. Our influence \nand investment in this sector give us an \nopportunity to advance initiatives that \npromote responsible lending and acceler-\nate financing to support this transition. \n\nWorking in collaboration with other \nbanks and organizations within the \nshipping industry, Citi helped to develop \nand was a founding signatory of the \nPoseidon Principles. Released in 2019, \nthese Principles provide a framework for \nlenders, lessors and financial guarantors \nto integrate climate considerations into \nlending decisions with international \nshipping clients to help the sector \ndecarbonize in line with the goals of the \nInternational Maritime Organization. \nAs a part of our commitment under the \nPoseidon Principles, we will be measuring \nand disclosing the carbon intensity of our \nshipping portfolio on an annual basis. We \nexpect to publish our first disclosure in \nalignment with these Principles in 2020.\n\nCiti is also a member of the Getting to \nZero Coalition, which is focused on the \ndevelopment of commercially viable, \nzero-emission vessels and other needed \nmaritime infrastructure for scalable net- \nzero-carbon energy sources, including \nproduction, distribution, storage and \nbunkering. Launched during Climate \nWeek NYC in September 2019 with over \n100 coalition members and supported \nby 14 governments, this coalition is coor-\ndinated by the Global Maritime Forum, \nFriends of Ocean Action and the World \nEconomic Forum.  \n\n59\n\n\f##PAGE_BREAK##Contents \n\n  Our Approach to ESG \n\n  Solutions for Impact \n\n  How We Do Business \n\n  Appendices             \n\n2019 Projects Covered by the Equator Principles\n\nAs part of our commitment to the Equator Principles (EP),  \nwe report annually on our implementation. \n\nFunded EP Project \nFinance Loans\n\nFunded EP Project- \nRelated Corporate  \nand Bridge Loans\n\nFunded EP Project \nFinance Advisories\n\nA\n\nB\n\nC\n\nCategory A \u2014 Projects likely to have potential significant \nadverse social or environmental impacts that are diverse, \nirreversible or unprecedented\n\nCategory B \u2014 Projects likely to have potential limited \nadverse social or environmental impacts that are few in \nnumber, generally site-specific, largely reversible and \nreadily addressed through mitigation measures\n\nCategory C \u2014 Projects likely to have minimal or  \nno social or environmental impacts\n\n0\n3\n1\n\n1\n5\n0\n\n1\n0\n0\n\nTotal = 4\n\nTotal = 6\n\nTotal = 1\n\nFunded Project Finance Loans Breakdown\n\nFunded Project-Related Corporate and Bridge Loans Breakdown\n\nBy Sector\n\nInfrastructure\n\nOil, Gas and Petrochemicals\n\nPower \u2014 Wind\n\nBy Region\n\nAsia Pacific\n\nEurope\n\nLatin America\n\nMiddle East and Africa\n\nU.S. and Canada\n\nBy Country Designation\n\nDesignated*\n\nNon-designated**\n\nBy Independent Review\n\nYes\n\nNo\n\nA\n\n-\n\n-\n\n-\n\nA\n\n-\n\n-\n\n-\n\n-\n\n-\n\nA\n\n-\n\n-\n\nA\n\n-\n\n-\n\nFunded EP Project Finance Advisories\n\nBy Sector\n\nPulp and Paper\n\nBy Region\n\nLatin America\n\nBy Country Designation\n\nDesignated*\n\nNon-designated**\n\nA\n\n1\n\nA\n\n1\n\nA\n\n-\n\n1\n\n60\n\nB\n\n-\n\n1\n\n2\n\nB\n\n-\n\n-\n\n1\n\n-\n\n2\n\nB\n\n2\n\n1\n\nB\n\n3\n\n-\n\nB\n\n-\n\nB\n\n-\n\nB\n\n-\n\n-\n\nC\n\n1\n\n-\n\n-\n\nC\n\n-\n\n-\n\n-\n\n-\n\n1\n\nC\n\n1\n\n-\n\nC\n\n-\n\n1\n\nC\n\n-\n\nC\n\n-\n\nC\n\n-\n\n-\n\nTotal\n\nBy Sector\n\n1\n\n1\n\n2\n\nInfrastructure\n\nManufacturing\n\nOil, Gas and Petrochemicals\n\nTotal\n\nPower \u2014 Gas and Diesel\n\n0\n\n0\n\n1\n\n0\n\n3\n\nPower \u2014 Wind\n\nBy Region\n\nAsia Pacific\n\nEurope\n\nLatin America\n\nTotal\n\nMiddle East and Africa\n\n3\n\n1\n\nU.S. and Canada\n\nBy Country Designation\n\nTotal\n\nDesignated*\n\nNon-designated**\n\nBy Independent Review\n\nYes\n\nNo\n\nA\n\n-\n\n-\n\n1\n\n-\n\n-\n\nA\n\n1\n\n-\n\n-\n\n-\n\n-\n\nA\n\n-\n\n1\n\nA\n\n1\n\n-\n\nB\n\n1\n\n1\n\n1\n\n1\n\n1\n\nB\n\n1\n\n1\n\n2\n\n-\n\n1\n\nB\n\n2\n\n3\n\nB\n\n3\n\n2\n\nC\n\n-\n\n-\n\n-\n\n-\n\n-\n\nC\n\n-\n\n-\n\n-\n\n-\n\n-\n\nC\n\n-\n\n-\n\nC\n\n-\n\n-\n\nTotal\n\n1\n\n1\n\n2\n\n1\n\n1\n\nTotal\n\n2\n\n1\n\n2\n\n0\n\n1\n\nTotal\n\n2\n\n4\n\nTotal\n\n4\n\n2\n\n*   Designated Countries as defined by the Equator Principles are high-income \n\nOECD countries.

To increase transparency, we \nhave prepared this Environmental, Social \nand Governance Report in accordance \nwith the UN Guiding Principles Reporting \nFramework (see UNGP index).\n\nCiti regularly updates our policies and \npractices to strengthen our human \nrights due diligence. During the devel-\nopment and subsequent updates of \nour Statement on Human Rights, which \nwe first adopted in 2007, we engaged \ninternal and external stakeholders to help \nassess our actual and potential adverse \nhuman rights impacts and to identify the \nmost salient human rights risks faced by \nour employees, workers connected to our \nsupply chain and individuals who might \nbe impacted by our clients\u2019 operations. \nWe published the most recent update to \nour Statement on Human Rights in late \n2018. \n\nIn addition, Citi\u2019s Environmental and \nSocial Risk Management (ESRM) Policy, \nadopted in 2003 and summarized in \nour Environmental and Social Policy \nFramework, guides our approach to \nassessing environmental and social issues \nrelated to financing our clients\u2019 business \nactivities. For more information about our \nESRM Policy and related due diligence \nprocesses, see the ESRM section of this \nreport.\n\nEach year, we publish a UK Modern \nSlavery Act transparency statement \nsummarizing our approach to identify-\ning and mitigating the risks of modern \nslavery in our operations \u2014 including \n\nclient transactions \u2014 and in our supply \nchain. It covers information about our \ngovernance and policies related to \nmodern slavery, risk assessment and due \ndiligence processes, and training. \n\nAnalysis and feedback from third parties \nprovide valuable perspective as we work \nto improve our policies and practices in \nthis area. In November 2019, BankTrack \nreleased its third Human Rights \nBenchmark for global banks.

We have spent more than \na decade working on the most salient \nhuman rights risks related to our busi-\nness \u2014 those that pose the greatest risk \nto people \u2014 including the activities of our \nclients and other business partners. We \nidentified most of these risks under our \nESRM Policy as \u201cAreas of High Caution\u201d \nseveral years before the advent of the \nUN Guiding Principles. To identify these \nareas, we focused on the most severe \npotential risks posed to people by our \nclients\u2019 activities, particularly in the \ncontext of project finance. Our work \nto address these risks has included \nhelping to found and govern the Equator \n\nPrinciples (EP) framework to enhance and \nstandardize risk management across the \nbanking sector, establishing an internal \nESRM team, and developing our risk \nidentification and mitigation policies and \nprocedures. (See page 66 for more about \nhow we manage these risks.)\n\nFinancial Access for \nSurvivors of Modern \nSlavery and Human \nTrafficking\n\nIn September 2019, the UN \nFinancial Sector Commission \non Modern Slavery and Human \nTrafficking released its final report, \nUnlocking Potential: A Blueprint \nfor Mobilizing Finance Against \nSlavery and Trafficking.

Our Code \nof Conduct prohibits unlawful discrimi-\nnation, harassment and other behaviors \nthat infringe on individual rights. This \npolicy applies to all employees, as well \nas to suppliers, clients and community \npartners globally.\n\nEfforts to promote diversity and inclu-\nsion are not always discussed in terms \nof human rights, but they are human \nrights concerns, as they seek to protect \nindividuals from unlawful discrimination \non the basis of essential characteristics \nthat relate directly to a person\u2019s sense of \ndignity. These efforts also aim to remedy \ndisparities in the treatment of women and \nminorities in the workplace. Respect for \ndiversity and inclusion is a high priority \nwherever we operate and can become \na particular concern in countries where \nthere is no legal protection against \ndiscrimination based on gender, gender \nidentity, race, ethnicity, age, religion, \nphysical or mental disability or medical \ncondition, or sexual orientation, in \naddition to a range of other essential \ncharacteristics inherent to identity and \npersonhood. Citi prohibits discrimination \nand harassment of our employees in all \nforms regardless of whether individual \nprotections are legally mandated in the \ncountries and communities where we \noperate. In fact, we know that even in \nlocations where anti-discrimination laws \nexist, there is still a need for companies \nto ensure they are doing their part to \nrespect individual rights.\n\nDuring 2019 we raised the minimum wage \nof our U.S.-based employees to $15 an \nhour. We also continued our study of pay \nequity across the company to identify \ngaps in pay between men and women \n\nCiti 2019 ESG Report\f##PAGE_BREAK##globally and minorities and nonminorities \nin the U.S. Learn more about our pay gap \nanalyses and broader diversity and inclu-\nsion efforts in the Talent and Diversity \nsection. \n\nFreedom of Association\n\nWhile the financial services industry is \nnot heavily unionized, we do have unions \nor work councils in many of the countries \nwhere we operate. Approximately  \n12 percent of our employee population \nis covered by collective bargaining \nagreements. We engage directly with \nour employees and through these asso-\nciations to discuss issues such as health \nand safety, remuneration, work hours, \ntraining, career development, work \ntime flexibility and equal opportunity. \nInformation related to freedom of asso-\nciation is communicated to employees \nthrough various mediums, including \nemployee handbooks, our intranet and \nemployee emails.\n\nExtending Respect  \nfor Human Rights \nThrough Our Suppliers \nand Partners\n\nOur nondiscrimination policies extend \nto Citi\u2019s and the Citi Foundation\u2019s phil-\nanthropic activity and to Citi\u2019s suppliers. \nWe do not provide funding to organiza-\ntions that discriminate on the basis of \npersonal characteristics, such as gender, \nrace and sexual orientation, among \nothers. We communicate our approach \nto human rights to our suppliers in our \nStatement of Supplier Principles. Our \napproach is reinforced by our Corporate \nResponsibility Questionnaire (CRQ), which \nhelps our procurement team determine \nhow well potential and current suppli-\ners manage environmental and social \nsustainability issues, including human \nrights issues. Our CRQ for the Europe, \nMiddle East and Africa (EMEA) region \nincludes questions specific to modern \n\nslavery concerns, and we are planning to \nimplement these questions across other \nregions as well.\n\nIn 2017, we conducted an assessment \nof our Tier 1 suppliers at certain spend \nthresholds in EMEA to assess modern \nslavery-related risks. Following that \nassessment, we have been engaging \nsuppliers deemed of greatest risk to \nbetter understand their approach to \nmanaging these risks. In 2018, we initi-\nated a pilot for our highest-risk suppliers \nin the following sectors: building services, \ncleaning services and supplies, catering \nservices, and ground transportation \nand other transportation sectors. We \nexpanded this work in 2019 to target 219 \nsuppliers with enhanced due diligence \nquestions about their specific policies \nand procedures to identify, prevent and \nmitigate risks of modern slavery in their \noperations and supply chains. We are \nusing the responses we received from \nthis initial group of high-risk suppliers \nto develop a methodology for assessing \nand categorizing the quality of the \ninformation provided. We will then roll \nout the program globally to enable the \n\nscreening and escalation of higher-risk \nsuppliers for further engagement in a \nconsistent fashion across our regional \nsourcing teams. More information about \nour efforts to combat modern slavery is \navailable in our 2019 UK Modern Slavery \nAct transparency statement.  \n\nThe work we do to fight modern slavery \nthroughout our value chain, along with \nour related reporting, policies, due \ndiligence and risk assessments, demon-\nstrates Citi\u2019s commitment to SDG 8, \nwhich aims to promote sustained, inclu-\nsive and sustainable economic growth, \nfull and productive employment and \ndecent work for all. In particular, our \nwork in these areas addresses target 8.7, \nwhich includes a mandate to eradicate \nforced labor, end modern slavery and \nhuman trafficking and end child labor in \nall its forms.\n\nSDG Goal 8: Decent Work and Economic \nGrowth\n\nFor more information on our supply \nchain, see the Operations and Supply \nChain section.\n\nCalling for Inclusion  \nof Refugees \n\nIn 2019, we reinforced our commit-\nment to refugees by signing the \nBusiness Refugee Action Network\u2019s \nstatement on the Sustainable \nDevelopment Goals. The statement \nadvocates for the inclusion of \nrefugees to make progress toward \nthe SDGs and recognizes the critical \nrole of business to ensure they \nare not left behind.

Under this \npolicy, we require clients or partners that \nare U.S. firearms retailers or firearms \nmanufacturers that sell through U.S. \nretail channels to adhere to a set of best \npractices regarding the sale of firearms. \nFor retailers, these practices include \nselling firearms only to individuals who \nhave completed a background check, not \n\nRecognition of Our Work  \nto End Gun Violence\nIn 2019, Citi received the Corporate Action \nAward from the Brady Center to Prevent \nGun Violence during the first-ever Brady \nAction Awards. The award was in recog-\nnition of Citi\u2019s U.S. Commercial Firearms \nPolicy, which enforces a set of best \npractices for our U.S. clients and partners \nregarding the sale of firearms. Citi contin-\nues to support the Second Amendment to \nthe U.S. Constitution and the rights of Citi \ncustomers to purchase firearms. At the \nsame time, in response to horrific acts of \ngun violence in our communities, we also \nrecognized our responsibility to establish \nthis policy, which includes common-sense \nprovisions for the responsible sale of \nfirearms. The elements of the policy have \nstrong bipartisan support and are backed \nby many gun owners.  \n\nselling high-capacity magazines or bump \nstocks (which modify semiautomatic fire-\narms to fire faster, at rates comparable \nto fully automatic firearms), and selling \nfirearms to individuals under age 21 only \nif they have received firearms safety \ntraining (e.g., as part of active or former \nmilitary or law enforcement employ-\nment or via hunter safety training). For \nmanufacturers, best practice entails \nonly selling firearms to retailers who are \nfollowing these same practices. \n\nAnother opportunity we have to thwart \nhuman rights abuses is through our anti-\nmoney laundering efforts, which help us \nprevent criminally sourced funds \u2014 includ-\ning funds associated with human rights \nabuses, such as human trafficking \u2014 from \npassing through our bank. Disrupting \nthe flow of money to those perpetrating \nhuman rights abuses and denying those \nabusers safe harbor for illicit proceeds \ntied to corruption or human rights viola-\ntions are effective ways to undermine \ntheir efforts.\n\nWhile these two examples illustrate our \nability to proactively avoid business \ntransactions with adverse human rights \nimpacts, there are other situations in \nwhich the link between our financial \nservices and adverse human rights \nimpacts is less direct. That complexity \nmay mean we have less leverage, and \nit diminishes our ability to ensure that \non-the-ground outcomes are consistent \nwith Citi\u2019s values. In these instances, we \nwork to improve our clients\u2019 awareness \nand business practices. In addition, \nwhere a transaction\u2019s financial and legal \nstructure allows it, we put loan covenants \nin place and monitor mitigation efforts \nthrough ESRM systems and corrective \naction plans.\n\nHuman Rights Due \nDiligence in Client \nTransactions\n\nCiti has thousands of corporate and insti-\ntutional clients. The UN Guiding Principles \nacknowledge the challenges posed by \n\nhaving such extensive business relation-\nships, and we have adopted the approach \nset out in the Principles of prioritizing our \ndue diligence and risk mitigation first to \nareas where the risk of adverse human \nrights impact is most significant from \nthe perspective of people who could be \naffected. We use our ESRM Policy, where \napplicable, to assess and manage risks \nconsistently and evaluate client projects \nand activities against a common set \nof environmental and social standards \ngrounded in international best practice, \nincluding human rights norms and the \nInternational Finance Corporation\u2019s \nPerformance Standards. \n\nOur ESRM team screens transactions \ncovered by our ESRM Policy during the \ninitial marketing phase to identify any \nclient activities we believe pose height-\nened risks to workers or local commu-\nnities. Our policy prohibits financing \nany project for which our due diligence \nindicates a risk of harmful or exploitative \nforms of forced labor or child labor or \nwhen the relevant labor forces have \nbeen subjected to human trafficking. In \naddition, the policy covers Areas of High \nCaution \u2014 heightened environmental and \nsocial risks that require closer due dili-\ngence and additional risk management. \nThese are issues we have identified as \nsalient human rights risks related to our \ncorporate and investment banking clients\u2019 \nactivities. They include the following: \n\n \u2022 Conflict risk: Certain sectors may \n\npresent a greater degree of proj-\nect-induced conflict risk, which may \nbe tied to competition for resources \nor land. In such cases, Citi carefully \nassesses key conflict factors such as \nsources of tension and root causes \nof conflict, actors and their inter-\nests, and development needs and \nincentives to address such risk in the \nproject\u2019s area of influence.\n\n \u2022 Indigenous Peoples: Various con-\n\ncerns can arise regarding the extent \nto which indigenous communities are \nconsulted during project develop-\nment and have consented to impacts \n\n66\n\nCiti 2019 ESG Report\f##PAGE_BREAK##to their land, livelihood and cultural \nheritage.\n\n \u2022 Labor: There are risks related to \n\nlabor forces used in the construction \nof projects or other operations, \nincluding risks associated with forced \nlabor, child labor and human traffick-\ning by project operators and their \nsubcontractors.\n\n \u2022 Resettlement: The resettlement \n\nof local communities, including \nindigenous groups, can be necessary \nfor project implementation. When \nthis occurs, it should be conducted \nthrough carefully designed resettle-\nment action plans that are reviewed \nby project lenders in advance \nof implementation and should, \nwhere necessary, include efforts \ntoward achieving the free, prior and \ninformed consent of indigenous \ncommunities.\n\n \u2022 Security practices: Security \n\nconcerns can arise relating to how \nproject sponsors engage with public \nor private security forces protecting \nproject sites. In such circumstances, \nif we decide to proceed with financ-\ning, we will advise project sponsors \non the implementation of interna-\ntional standards, such as those in the \nVoluntary Principles on Security and \nHuman Rights.\n\nIf, during our initial screening or more \nextensive due diligence for a transac-\ntion, we find there is a risk of adverse \nimpacts, we carefully evaluate the client\u2019s \ncurrent commitment and capacity to \navoid, mitigate and/or manage those \nimpacts in accordance with international \nindustry best practices and human rights \nnorms and their willingness to engage in \ncontinual learning and improvement. We \nescalate the most challenging cases with \nthe potential for severe adverse impacts \nto senior business and risk managers \nfor collective discussion on the risks and \nthe client\u2019s commitment and capacity. \nIn some cases, senior management will \nconclude that the likelihood for adverse \nimpacts is too great \u2014 posing an imminent \n\nthreat to people or communities \u2014 and we \nwill re-evaluate the client relationship or \ndecline involvement in the transaction. \nThis is a move we take very seriously \nas we recognize that terminating the \nrelationship can have a number of ramifi-\ncations, including removing any leverage \nwe might otherwise have had to improve \npractices over time through constructive \nengagement.\n\nAfter the financial close of project- \nrelated transactions that have time- \nbound environmental and social action \nplans, we monitor the project sponsor\u2019s \nimplementation of those actions through \nthe construction and operation phases of \nthe project \u2014 often through the retention \nof an independent environmental and \nsocial risk consultant who periodically \nreports to lenders following on-the-\nground audits. For more information,  \nsee the ESRM section.\n\nTransactions Reviewed \nUnder Citi\u2019s Statement on \nHuman Rights\n\nIn 2019, the ESRM team screened 557 \ntotal transactions during the initial \nmarketing phase, and of those, 44 were \nflagged as requiring additional due \ndiligence for human rights risks. This \nscreening does not include other human \nrights risk assessments the ESRM team \nundertakes as part of annual client \nreviews or portfolio reviews. The specific \ntypes of risks we uncovered are outlined \nin the table below. Of the 44 transactions \nflagged for additional human rights due \ndiligence, 18 proceeded to close after \nwe confirmed the clients were managing \nand mitigating the potential risk appro-\npriately. Transactions may not reach \nfinancial close for a number of reasons, \nnot solely due to ESRM review.\n\nIdentifying Human Rights Risks in Transactions*\n\nHuman Rights Risks\n\nReviewed in 2019\n\nClosed in 2019\n\nConflict Risk\n\nIndigenous Peoples\n\nLabor Risks\n\nResettlement\n\nSecurity Practices\n\nWater\n\n8\n\n17\n\n9\n\n8\n\n7\n\n4\n\n2\n\n6\n\n6\n\n4\n\n1\n\n1\n\nTotal Transactions\n\n44\n\n18\n\n* One transaction may have more than one human rights risk.\n\n67\n\n\f##PAGE_BREAK##Contents \n\n  Our Approach to ESG \n\n  Solutions for Impact \n\n  How We Do Business \n\n  Appendices             \n\nProviding Access to \nRemedy\n\nThe UN Guiding Principles call on \ngovernments and companies to play their \nrespective roles in ensuring that victims \nof human rights abuse have access to \neffective remedies. Remedy can take \nmany different forms, including apolo-\ngies, financial or nonfinancial compen-\nsation or efforts to prevent future harm \nthrough policy commitments and changes \nin operational practice. The purpose of \nremedy is to help make victims whole \nagain or to restore them, as much as \n\nApplying Our Policies \nto Protect Human \nRights and Reduce Risk\n\nWhen our due diligence processes \nuncover the risk of human rights \nviolations in potential or estab-\nlished client relationships, we inves-\ntigate further and, when necessary, \nengage with our clients to better \nunderstand their approach to \nmanaging such risks. When needed, \nwe work with them to identify \ncorrective action in alignment with \ninternational best practices. \n\nIf proactive management of \nhuman rights risks is not possible, \nwe might re-evaluate the client \nrelationship or deny financing or \ninvolvement in a particular transac-\ntion. During 2019, we exited a rela-\ntionship with a client in the palm \noil industry who failed to follow \nour policy requirement of main-\ntaining certification through the \nRoundtable on Sustainable Palm \nOil (RSPO) \u2014 a multistakeholder \ninitiative with principles and criteria \nregarding sustainable palm oil. \n\npossible, to their lives and enjoyment \nof their rights before those rights were \nviolated. Remedy can also help ensure \nthat they and others will not suffer similar \nharm in the future.\n\nAs a financial institution, our approach \nto remedy usually involves working with \nclients to ensure they have the right \npolicies in place and channels available \nto enable victims to lodge grievances. In \naddition, these companies must follow \nup on allegations and have established \nprocesses to offer remedies or cooperate \nwith authorities to make sure effective \nremedy is provided. \n\nContinuous Learning\n\nEngaging Stakeholders\n\nTo ensure that we are living up to our \ncommitment to respect human rights \nand anticipate emerging risks, we \nregularly communicate our approach \nexternally and engage with stakeholders \non their issues of concern. During 2019, \nwe participated in a project to improve \nmetrics related to human rights reporting \nthrough Shift. Citi also acted as co-lead \nfor the EP Social Risk working group, \nwhich developed new language and \nguidance on both protection of the rights \nof Indigenous Peoples and human rights \nrisk assessment.\n\nIn addition, we pay close attention to \nhuman rights issues raised by stakehold-\ners within specific industries, such as the \nenergy sector and palm oil. We engage \nwith these industries directly through \nclient relationships, stakeholder meetings \nand active participation in groups. For \ninstance, our participation in the RSPO \nenables us to engage with multiple \nstakeholders connected to the palm oil \nvalue chain in the hopes of enhancing \nour leverage and improving the collective \neffort of those connected to particular \ncommodities or risks. \n\nWhile in recent years banks have come \nunder increasing pressure to disclose \nspecific findings related to client projects, \nwe are bound by legal requirements and \nbusiness ethics related to confidentiality \nthat limit our ability to disclose such \ninformation without client consent. \nAddressing requests for transparency will \ncontinue to be a balancing act between \nprotecting the confidentiality of our \nclients\u2019 information and disclosing infor-\nmation to stakeholders as appropriate to \nadvance the protection of human rights. \nIn 2019, we responded both informally \nand in writing to a variety of human \nrights inquiries regarding our financing \nactivities and our general due diligence \npractices. These inquiries came from \nnongovernmental organizations such \nas BankTrack, the Business and Human \nRights Resource Centre, the Investor \nAlliance for Human Rights and the Sierra \nClub.\n\nReporting Mechanisms  \nfor Stakeholders\n\nOur Ethics Hotline provides a way for our \nemployees, suppliers and other external \nstakeholders, including the general \npublic, to report concerns about uneth-\nical behavior to Citi\u2019s Ethics Office. This \nincludes human rights-related issues such \nas workplace harassment, violations of \nsupply chain standards or concerns over \nproject financing activities. Stakeholders \nand whistleblowers can report violations \nto the Ethics Hotline using a 24-hour \nphone line, email address, fax line, \nwebsite or physical mailing address.\n\nIn addition, for certain qualifying proj-\nects, we apply the Equator Principles to \nassess and manage environmental and \nsocial risks. The EP framework includes \nan assessment of the project sponsor\u2019s \nstakeholder engagement process, as well \nas its operational-level grievance mech-\nanisms for affected communities to raise \nconcerns proactively with the project \ndevelopers.\n\n68\n\nCiti 2019 ESG Report\f##PAGE_BREAK##Employee Training\n\nWhat\u2019s Ahead\n\nHuman rights content is integrated into \nthe training we provide for the employees \nresponsible for implementing our ESRM \nPolicy and in our Code of Conduct train-\ning, which is required of all employees. \nDuring 2019, we developed a comprehen-\nsive module on modern slavery, which so \nfar has been provided to more than 1,000 \nsupply chain employees globally. As we \ncontinue to roll out training, we will iden-\ntify staff across the company whose work \nwould be enhanced through this training.  \n\nThe robust policies and programs we have in place throughout our business help us \navoid or effectively address a range of human rights impacts. We are also continu-\nally engaging stakeholders and surveying the global landscape to identify emerg-\ning human rights risks that might affect our business and our stakeholders. For \ninstance, the use of artificial intelligence to boost surveillance and restrict freedom \nof movement in some parts of the world is a growing human rights threat. In \naddition, our conversations about climate change with clients, peers and industry \norganizations increasingly include concerns about the impact of a warming planet \non human rights. We will continue to monitor these issues and other emerging \ntrends to protect our stakeholders and use our influence to uphold human rights \nglobally.  \n\n69\n\n\f##PAGE_BREAK##Contents \n\n  Our Approach to ESG \n\n  Solutions for Impact \n\n  How We Do Business \n\n  Appendices             \n\nOperations and \nSupply Chain\n\nHIGHLIGHTS\n\nAddressing climate risk  \nWe invest in climate adaptation solutions \nfor our operations to increase resiliency\nPage 75\n\nGreen Teams recognized\nEmployee-led teams in Florida and Costa \nRica received awards for sustainability- \nfocused volunteer efforts\nPage 76\n\nOpportunities for diverse banks\nMentorship of a small, minority-owned \nbank is opening doors for future work\nPage 80\n\nCapitalizing on the tremendous opportunity we have \nfor positive impact through our global operations, we \nhave established commitments1 to further minimize the \nenvironmental footprints of our facilities and to ensure \nhigh environmental and social standards throughout our \nsupply chain. \n\nResource Use and \nEnvironmental \nImpacts\n\nWe have been measuring our environ-\nmental footprint for 20 years and began \nreporting on our direct operational \nimpacts in 2002.

Also, in recognition of \nthe connection between environmental \nsustainability and employee well-being, \nwe continued implementing improve-\nments in our workspaces and encourag-\ning employee wellness initiatives.\n\n2020 Goals\n\nWe are currently tracking progress \nagainst our third generation of opera-\ntional footprint goals \u2014 our 2020 goals, \nwhich we first announced in 2015. These \ngoals cover energy use, water consump-\ntion, recycling, waste and green building, \nand, in 2017, we announced a goal to \nuse 100 percent renewable electricity to \npower our facilities globally by 2020. In \n2018, we achieved three of these goals \ntwo years early, and during 2019 we made \nprogress in all the areas we measure. We \ncontinue to work toward achievement \nof all six goals and are on track to reach \nat least five of them by the end of 2020, \nas expected. While our strong focus on \nwater has enabled us to surpass our \n2020 goal for total water use reduction, \nour goal to use reclaimed or recycled \nwater for at least 10 percent of our water \nconsumption has proven more challeng-\ning. We are continuing to push forward in \nthis area and identify more places where \nthe use of reclaimed or recycled water is \na viable option.   \n\nIn 2019, we continued to make progress \nagainst our goal to source 100 percent \nrenewable electricity across Citi\u2019s global \noperations. We own or lease more than \n50 million square feet of real estate \nacross 7,700 properties in 95 countries. \nIt is complex to secure renewable \nelectricity in many of these markets, \nespecially where renewable electricity \nresources are less developed, where we \nhave a smaller presence or where we do \nnot directly source electricity for our \n\noperations. In order to meet our ambi-\ntious goal, we have established power \npurchase agreements (PPAs) in Mexico \nand the U.S.; secured utility green supply \ncontracts in the U.S. and the UK and \nother parts of Europe; and are obtaining \nenergy attribute certificates in the form \nof renewable energy certificates (RECs), \ninternational RECs, and guarantees of \norigin that support voluntary renewable \nelectricity markets across each of our \noperating regions. We also use on-site \npower when feasible, though it makes up \na small portion of our overall renewable \nportfolio. We have already completed \nthe work necessary to power our North \nAmerica facilities with renewable elec-\ntricity beginning in 2020. During 2019, \nwe made progress across our Asia Pacific \nand Europe, Middle East and Africa \n(EMEA) regions as well, so we will be able \n\nto meet our goal of sourcing 100 percent \nrenewable electricity for all our facilities \nby the end of 2020. In connection with \nour renewable electricity commitment, \nCiti is a member of RE100 \u2014 a global \ninitiative led by the Climate Group and \nCDP, which are both part of the We Mean \nBusiness coalition.\n\nDetailed data showing progress toward \nall of our 2020 goals are included at the \nend of this section.

Our sustain-\nability efforts in Hong Kong were \nrecognized with awards from a \nnumber of organizations during \n2019, including China Light & \nPower, the International Facility \nManagement Association and the \nWorld Green Organisation.  \n\n73\n\nIn 2019, we opened a new operations facility in Sioux Falls, South Dakota, for which we achieved LEED \nGold certification.\n\nSustainable Building  \nPrinciples in Action\n\nWhether undertaking new construction \nor renovating existing buildings, we \nprioritize efficiency and sustainability to \nminimize the environmental impact of our \nfacilities across the globe. As part of our \nenergy reduction efforts for our facilities \nin North America, we are retrofitting our \nbranches, offices and operations centers \nwith LED lighting. As of the end of 2019, \n9.4 million square feet, representing  \n89 percent of the square footage of \nour offices and operations centers, had \nbeen retrofitted. We have also completed \nlighting retrofits at 378 banking branches \nwith an additional 144 to be completed \nin 2020. We expect this retrofit, once \ncomplete in 2020, to reduce our energy \nconsumption related to lighting by up \nto 50 percent. Switching to LED lighting \nalso helps improve the overall quality of \nlighting and reduces maintenance costs.\n\nThe renovation of our global headquar-\nters in New York, for which we were \nawarded LEED Platinum certification, is \non track to be completed in 2020. During \nconstruction, approximately 98 percent \nof all concrete, steel and glass demolition \nmaterial was transported to recycling \nfacilities, where it was converted back \ninto new building products. With this \nrenovation, we are installing water- \nconserving plumbing fixtures, enhancing \nthe green space outside the building and \nimplementing systems to improve indoor \nair quality. Water retention tanks on \nthe building\u2019s roof will capture 2 million \ngallons of rainwater annually, which we \nwill use to irrigate plants on the build-\ning\u2019s plaza and terraces. In addition, our \ncogeneration plant, fueled by natural gas, \nwill produce heat and electricity on-site, \nreducing the building\u2019s carbon footprint \nby 34 percent. This significant, multiyear \nundertaking has been a driving force in \nsolidifying our approach to sustainable \nbuilding principles and a catalyst for the \n\n\f##PAGE_BREAK##Contents \n\n  Our Approach to ESG \n\n  Solutions for Impact \n\n  How We Do Business \n\n  Appendices             \n\nimplementation of efficiency projects \nthroughout the global footprint of our \nfacilities. \n\nThese sustainable building efforts,  \namong others, support our goal to have \n33 percent of our real estate portfolio  \nLEED-certified by the end of 2020. \n\nEfficient Travel Options\n\nWe encourage employees to use video \nand web conferencing technologies \nrather than traveling, whenever possible. \nWhen business travel is unavoidable, we \nask employees to group trips together to \nmanage costs and reduce the number of \ntrips taken, and we offer employees the \noption of train travel whenever feasible. \nMany of our offices are centrally located \nnear public transportation, which reduces \nthe need for employees to drive to work. \nTo encourage the use of these options \nand reduce the impact of employee \ncommuting, we offer U.S.-based employ-\nees pre-tax dollars to cover the cost of \ncommuting by subway, bus, train, ferry \nand vanpool. We also offer bike storage \nand bike racks at a number of facilities \nand sponsor bike share programs, known \nas Citi Bike\u00ae Program, in New York City, \nJersey City and Miami. At our car park in \nthe London Citigroup Center, we offer a \ndozen charging stations for those driving \nelectric vehicles. Business travel and \nemployee commuting are reported as \npart of our Scope 3 emissions data.\n\nTransparent Reporting \nof Operational Climate \nImpacts\n\nEmployees in Colombia Champion Sustainable Transportation \nIn 2016, Citi employees in Bogot\u00e1, Colombia, launched the Citi Mobility program, which \nfocuses on transportation solutions that benefit the environment, the company and the \ncity. The program provides the bank\u2019s employees with rapid, safe and convenient ways \nto get to and from work. As of the end of 2019, it has led to more than 46,000 carpool-\ning trips; more than 7,300 trips by bicycle; and more than 3,900 commutes by walking. \nEfforts like these earned the program first place in the 2019 Sustainability Challenge \nsponsored by Try My Ride, a company committed to promoting sustainability mobility. \nThe Citi Mobility program was judged to have done the most to reduce CO2 emissions, \nimprove quality of life for employees and promote sustainable mobility during the one-\nmonth challenge. Citi Colombia was also awarded a Gold Quality Seal by Bogot\u00e1\u2019s Secre-\ntary of Mobility in recognition of the high-quality, secure bicycle parking at the facility. \n\nCiti reports our Scope 1, Scope 2 and \nScope 3 GHG emissions in both this \nannual Environmental, Social and \nGovernance Report and in our CDP \nresponse. We began reporting on the \ndirect environmental impacts of our oper-\nations in 2002 and have submitted data \nto CDP every year since 2003. We follow \nthe GHG Protocol Corporate Standard \n\nand Scope 2 Guidance for measuring \nand reporting both market-based and \nlocation-based Scope 1 and Scope 2 GHG \nemissions. We also report Scope 3 CO2 \nemissions from employee air and train \ntravel and project-financed thermal \npower plants in this Environmental, Social \nand Governance Report, and we report \n\nScope 3 electricity transmission loss \nand employee commuting data to CDP. \nIn early 2020, Citi received a score of A \nfrom CDP on our climate change disclo-\nsure and an A- for supply chain reporting, \nfor 2018 data.\n\n74\n\nCiti 2019 ESG Report\f##PAGE_BREAK##Sustainable design was a priority throughout \nthe renovation of our global headquarters in \nNew York City. \n\nManaging Climate Risk  \nin Our Operations\n\nThe effects of climate change, particularly any associated extreme \nweather events, pose a potential risk to our operations. In addition \nto mitigating our risks by reducing GHG emissions through the use \nof renewable energy and improved energy efficiency, our Citi Realty \nServices group and crisis management and business continuity teams \nhelp us to monitor, prepare for and respond to a range of issues \u2014  \nincluding extreme weather events \u2014 that could disrupt our operations. \n\nBecause Citi operates in nearly 100 coun-\ntries, our facilities could be exposed to a \nrange of risks that vary in type based on \nthe location of each facility. To increase \nour resiliency, we have invested in climate \nadaptation solutions in a number of critical \nfacilities. In addition, our crisis manage-\nment team has developed action plans to \naddress immediate risks and support our \nemployees and customers before, during \nand after adverse events. Our business \ncontinuity team also has plans in place to \nhelp Citi resume business operations as \nquickly as possible in the aftermath of an \nextreme climate event. We are assessing the \nexposure of our global facilities to different \nclimate hazards and how that might change \n\nover time due to climate change. Moving \nforward, we also plan to incorporate phys-\nical risks related to climate change into \nthe scenario analyses we conduct on our \noperations.\n\nTo avoid the most severe negative impacts \nof climate change, it is estimated we must \nlimit global warming to no more than 1.5\u00b0C \nabove pre-industrial levels, an achieve-\nment that many climate experts suggest \nis unlikely at this stage. To address the \nseriousness and urgency of the challenge \nahead, Citi has established a goal to \ntransition to sourcing 100 percent renew-\nable power for our facilities by 2020. In \naddition, we have disclosed our emissions \n\nfor almost two decades and set significant \nreduction targets for our energy consump-\ntion. Disclosure of Scope 1, Scope 2 and \nScope 3 GHG emissions is a component of \nthe recommendations of the Task Force \non Climate-related Financial Disclosures \n(TCFD). Our disclosures can be found in our \nEnvironmental Impact Report at the end of \nthis section. In 2018, Citi published Finance \nfor a Climate-Resilient Future \u2014 a detailed \nreport of our activities and progress in \naccordance with the TCFD recommendations \nand metrics. We\u2019ve also included a TCFD \nindex in this report.\n\n75\n\n\f##PAGE_BREAK##Contents \n\n  Our Approach to ESG \n\n  Solutions for Impact \n\n  How We Do Business \n\n  Appendices             \n\nEnvironmental  \nSustainability and \nEmployee Well-Being\n\nWe encourage employees to participate \nin activities and initiatives that emphasize \nthe intersection of personal well-being \nand reduced environmental impact. For \ninstance, our Drink-Up initiative promotes \nhydration, but rather than stocking our \nbreakrooms with disposable plastic water \nbottles, we are converting the water \nfountains at our facilities to also work \nas bottle-filling stations. Based on the \namount of water dispensed via the bottle \nfillers, we estimate that we have helped \nemployees avoid the use of nearly  \n3.2 million water bottles in the U.S. and \nclose to 3.8 million in Mexico between  \nthe program\u2019s inception in 2016 and the \nend of 2019.\n\nTo further inspire well-being at work, our \nannual Step Up challenge encourages \n\nemployees to use the stairs and walking \npaths at our buildings to increase daily \nphysical activity and improve their \nhealth. Participating employees track the \nnumber of steps they take during walking \nbreaks at work. This initiative has gained \npopularity over the last few years, and \nin 2019 we developed a smartphone app \nto make it even easier for employees to \nparticipate and track progress. During \n2019, 1,300 employees logged more than \n120 million steps. \n\nIn addition, we recognize that wellness \nis an important aspect of sustainability \nin building design alongside more tradi-\ntional environmental considerations, \nsuch as energy and water efficiency and \nthe use of green materials. When looking \nat how our buildings can affect the \nwell-being of our employees, we consider \nair and water quality, opportunities to \nstay active, healthy food options and a \nwork environment that is both flexible \nand effective. As a result of these efforts, \n\nwe\u2019ve received WELL Silver certification \nfrom the International WELL Building \nInstitute\u2122 for facilities in Hong Kong \nand India over the last few years. The \nWELL Building Standard is a system for \nmeasuring, certifying and monitoring \nbuilding features that impact the health \nand well-being of occupants. \n\nEmployee Engagement\n\nWe engage employees in achieving our \nenvironmental sustainability objectives in \ntheir day-to-day activities and responsi-\nbilities at work, as well as through volun-\nteer efforts and Green Team activities.\n\nGreen Teams are employee-led groups \nthat design and lead environmental \ninitiatives \u2014 such as recycling drives, \nvolunteer projects, informative lectures \nand awareness campaigns \u2014 tailored \nto their workplaces and local commu-\nnities. We have 18 Green Teams, with \n2,670 employees, operating around the \n\nGreen Team members participating in a volunteer event  \nin Jacksonville, Florida\n\nMembers of the Costa Rica Green Team celebrating the Ecological Blue \nFlag award\n\n76\n\nCiti 2019 ESG Report\f##PAGE_BREAK##world. In 2019, these Green Teams held \n223 volunteer and educational events, \nresulting in 16,200 volunteer hours \ndedicated to helping communities. In \n2019, two of our Green Teams received \nrecognition for their sustainability \nefforts. In Jacksonville, Florida, the local \nGreen Team received the Jacksonville \nEnvironmental Protection Board\u2019s \nEnvironmental Achievement Award in \nthe large business category. Costa Rica\u2019s \nGreen Team received an Ecological \nBlue Flag award, which recognizes local \nefforts that promote conservation and \ndevelopment. In addition, in recognition \nof Earth Day, Citi Green Teams and other \ncolleagues organized environmental and \nsustainability events during the month  \nof April.\n\nEach year, our company participates in \nthe World Wildlife Fund\u2019s Earth Hour. \nIn March 2019, nearly 2,800 facilities \nin 98 countries turned off the lights \nbetween 8:30 p.m. and 9:30 p.m., local \ntime. Citi has participated in this event \nfor 12 consecutive years.\n\nResponsible Sourcing\n\nCiti seeks out suppliers that share our \nvalues and our commitment to having \na positive impact in the communities \nwhere we operate. We set high standards \nof performance for resource use and \nsupplier practices across our global \nsupply chain.  \n\nCiti\u2019s Supply Chain Development, \nInclusion and Sustainability team works \nwith procurement leaders across the \ncompany to support diversity in supplier \nselection, build the capacity of diverse \nsuppliers, implement sustainable supplier \ninitiatives and mitigate environmental \nand social risks in our supply chain. The \nteam champions inclusive and sustainable \nprocesses and practices as they engage \nwith Citi employees responsible for the \nsupplier selection process. This includes a \nfocus on engagement with women-owned \nbusinesses in developing countries, \nincreased due diligence related to human \n\nrights, including issues of modern slavery, \nand further integration of environmental \nsustainability priorities into business \npolicies. \n\nFor more information about our \napproach to human rights, see the \nHuman Rights section.\n\nIn 2015, Citi identified three focus areas \nas part of our Sustainable Progress \nStrategy: paper and paper products, \ninformation technology hardware and \ne-waste disposal, and travel and logistics. \nWe have developed position statements \nthat recommend actions for each of \nthese areas and incorporated them \ninto our supply chain Global Operating \nProcedures. In 2019, we continued engag-\ning employees and making progress in \nthese areas, including: \n\n \u2022 Performing an analysis of our \n\nprinters\n\n \u2022 Communicating the benefits of pur-\nchasing EPEAT-certified products to \nemployees who purchase items for \ntheir teams\n\n \u2022 Reinforcing the importance of \n\nsustainable practices in contractual \nlanguage for our technology hard-\nware suppliers that align with EPEAT  \n\nSupplier Policies\n\nWe have developed standards and poli-\ncies to support our efforts and clearly \ncommunicate our expectations to suppli-\ners regarding environmental and social \nissues, including the following:\n\n \u2022 The Citi Statement of Supplier \n\nPrinciples outlines the aspirational \nguidelines that anchor our sustain-\nable supply chain initiative, including \nthose related to ethical business \npractices, human rights in the \nworkplace, environmental sustain-\nability, management systems and \nimplementation.\n\n \u2022 The Citi Requirements for Suppliers, \nformerly known as Citi Standards for \nSuppliers, facilitates supplier compli-\nance with contractual requirements \nand other key Citi policy obligations.\n\n \u2022 Suppliers are also asked to abide by \nthe Citi Statement on Human Rights. \n\nIn addition, Citi complies with the UK \nModern Slavery Act and releases an \nannual transparency statement summa-\nrizing our approach to identifying and \nmitigating the risks of modern slavery in \nour operations and supply chain.\n\nSupplier Engagement  \nand Evaluation\n\nWe use a Corporate Responsibility \nQuestionnaire (CRQ) to evaluate \nsuppliers\u2019 adherence to our Statement \nof Supplier Principles. The CRQ helps \nus gauge how well suppliers manage a \nrange of issues, such as environmental \nmanagement, human rights, labor prac-\ntices, diversity, and health and safety. \nFor example, the CRQ for our EMEA \nregion includes specific questions to help \nidentify and contribute to eradicating \nchild labor and modern slavery, including \nforced or bonded labor and human \ntrafficking. We plan to implement these \nquestions across other regions in coming \nyears.\n\nIntegrating these important issues into \nour CRQ and our broader work to address \nthe issue of modern slavery is part of \nthe way Citi supports SDG 8, which aims \nto promote sustained, inclusive and \nsustainable economic growth, full and \nproductive employment and decent \nwork for all. In particular, our work in this \narea addresses target 8.7, which includes \na mandate to eradicate forced labor, end \nmodern slavery and human trafficking \nand end child labor in all its forms.\n\nSDG Goal 8: Decent Work and Economic \nGrowth\n\nGiven our global footprint, we rely on \na strong network of Global Champions \n\u2014 Citi colleagues around the world who \nserve as connections between their busi-\nnesses and supply chain sustainability \nand diversity efforts \u2014 to help implement \n\n77\n\n\f##PAGE_BREAK##Contents \n\n  Our Approach to ESG \n\n  Solutions for Impact \n\n  How We Do Business \n\n  Appendices             \n\nsustainable supplier initiatives locally \nand adapt the CRQ to local cultures and \nbusiness norms. We also translate the \nCRQ into 14 languages to make it easier \nfor suppliers to complete and to enable \nproductive follow-up conversations.\n\nOur goal is for suppliers to complete the \nCRQ every two years. If a supplier\u2019s CRQ \nscore is below 70 percent, we communi-\ncate our concerns and ask the supplier to \ntake action to improve and submit a new \nCRQ the following year. We have rolled \nout the CRQ to more than 30 percent of \nour suppliers and are focusing on imple-\nmentation with our top 100 suppliers \nbased on spend. In 2019, 16 percent of \nour top 100 suppliers scored 70 percent \nor lower on the CRQ. We meet with \nsuppliers that fall below the 70 percent \nthreshold and outline steps together to \nimprove these scores within the year \nwhen they resubmit. Additional training \nand face-to-face dialogue has proven to \n\nhelp suppliers quickly address any issues \nflagged related to their CRQ responses \nand align to Citi\u2019s expectations. If the \nnecessary improvement is not achieved \nwithin that year, we escalate review to \ndetermine whether the contract should \nbe discontinued. In addition, to ensure \na consistent approach and understand-\ning of the CRQ process and supplier \nevaluation, we provide training for our \nemployees. We also provide sustainability \ntraining and education to suppliers.\n\nSupplier Diversity \n\nOur Supply Chain Development, Inclusion \nand Sustainability team sets clear \nsupplier diversity goals and embeds them \nin our supplier selection processes. In \naddition, we provide U.S. small businesses \nand women-, veteran-, disability-, LGBT+- \nand minority-owned firms with access \nto business opportunities, education, \nmentoring and training. Working with a \nrange of supplier-focused organizations, \n\nwe identify diverse suppliers, including \nsmall businesses that can meet our \nsupply chain needs, help build these \nsuppliers\u2019 capacities and support supply \nchain diversity and inclusion more \nbroadly. These organizations include the \nNational Minority Supplier Development \nCouncil and several of its global affili-\nates, the Women\u2019s Business Enterprise \nCouncil, the National LGBT Chamber of \nCommerce and WEConnect International. \nWe also engage with UN Women and \nthe Sustainable Purchasing Leadership \nCouncil, an organization dedicated to \nsustainable purchasing efforts. \n\nFor every bid over $250,000, we require \nthe inclusion of diverse suppliers in \nthe bidding process. This requirement \nensures that diverse suppliers are consid-\nered not only for small engagements but \nfor large ones as well.

We also \nworked to identify existing women-owned \nCiti suppliers and encourage those not \nalready members of WEConnect to join \nin order to be more easily identified by \ncompanies seeking their services. In 2019, \nwe procured $149 million from women-\nowned businesses.\n\nOur efforts to support women-owned \nbusinesses align with SDG 5: Achieve \ngender equality and empower all women \nand girls. In particular, our work in this \narea helps address target 5.5, which aims \nto ensure women\u2019s full and effective \nparticipation and equal opportunities \nfor leadership at all levels of deci-\nsion-making in political, economic and \npublic life.\n\nSDG Goal 5: Gender Equality\n\nEngaging Diverse Broker-Dealers\nCiti has a history of consistently working with diverse broker-dealers, and we have \nused an underwriting syndicate composed of diverse third-party broker-dealers \u2014 \nincluding those that are minority-, veteran- and women-owned \u2014 for more than 15 \nyears. Since 2015, we have used exclusively minority- and women-owned businesses \nas co-managers on at least one transaction each year.\n\nIn 2019, we included at least seven diverse broker-dealers in each of our 12 USD, \nunsecured benchmark debt and capital offerings \u2014 using 30 different diverse firms \nthroughout the year. We also hosted our 15th annual broker-dealer breakfast, which \nprovides diverse broker-dealers with an opportunity to share best practices and  \nnetwork with Citi leaders.\n\n$1.18B\n\nTotal amount spent \non Tier 1 and Tier 2 \ndiverse suppliers in \n2019 \n($700 million direct  \nspend on Tier 1 only)\n\n79\n\n\f##PAGE_BREAK##Contents \n\n  Our Approach to ESG \n\n  Solutions for Impact \n\n  How We Do Business \n\n  Appendices             \n\nPaving the Way for Diverse Banks\n\nCiti is one of a handful of large national banks authorized to work as \nfinancial agents for the U.S. Department of the Treasury. This allows \nus to perform financial services on behalf of Treasury and its financial \nmanagement arm, the Bureau of the Fiscal Service. Through the Bureau\u2019s \nFinancial Agent Mentor-Prot\u00e9g\u00e9 Program, financial agents such as Citi \nare paired with small banks \u2014 including minority- and women-owned \nbanks \u2014 to pave the way for more firms in the minority-owned  \nbanking sector to perform important financial services for Treasury. \n\nActing on Treasury\u2019s commitment to \nachieve a more inclusive network of finan-\ncial agents, and our own commitment to \nincrease supplier diversity, we worked with \nTreasury to engage with the Washington \nD.C.-based, Black-owned Industrial Bank \nas the program\u2019s first certified prot\u00e9g\u00e9. \nIndustrial Bank was founded in the 1930s \nand has since grown to become one of the \nlargest minority-owned banks in the U.S., \nwith assets of more than $432 million.\n\nFor the past decade, Citi has been respon-\nsible for the day-to-day management of the \nBureau\u2019s OTCnet application, which auto-\nmates its point-of-sale/over-the-counter \ncheck-deposit process by capturing check \nimages. OTCnet processes $100 billion of \ndeposits annually. By jointly developing \nour proposal for the re-bid of the OTCnet \nprogram with Industrial Bank, the firm will \nbe able to become a full OTCnet partner. \nIndustrial will also participate in knowledge- \nsharing sessions with Citi aimed at \n\ntransferring our institutional expertise \nand experience to enrich Industrial Bank\u2019s \nqualifications. This work will put Industrial \nBank on a path to become a financial agent \nin the future and enable it to bid for federal \ncontracts on its own.\n\n80\n\nCiti 2019 ESG Report\f##PAGE_BREAK##In 2019, we continued our participation \nin an in-depth mentoring and training \nprogram called AC2A, in partnership \nwith the New York & New Jersey Minority \nSupplier Development Council, Rutgers \nUniversity, Covenant Business Concepts \nand other corporate sponsors. Through \nthis program, Citi works with diverse \nsuppliers and other corporate coaches to \nensure that diverse suppliers have access \nto information through workshops about \nsustainability, leadership development \nand coaching. This is the fifth year Citi \nhas participated in the program. Also in \n2019, in partnership with the Minority \nSupplier Development UK (MSDUK) \nprogram, we provided a scholarship \nfor a finalist of the MSDUK Innovation \nChallenge \u2014 a pitch competition for \nminority-owned businesses. \n\nWhat\u2019s Ahead \n\nWe have been measuring our operational \nenvironmental impacts for two decades \nand, over time, it\u2019s become increasingly \nclear that incremental improvements \nin this area are table stakes. We will \ncontinue to push ourselves to set more \nambitious goals that reduce our negative \nimpact on the environment, and we will \nalso continue to increase our focus on \npromoting positive social impacts within \nand beyond our firm, creating workspaces \nthat promote employee wellness and \nengaging employees in our effort to \ncreate a culture of sustainability. In our \nsupply chain, we will increase supplier \ndiversity both inside and outside the U.S. \nand pursue the growing opportunities \nwithin sustainable supply chain finance. \n\nBuilding the Capacity of Diverse \nSuppliers\n\nOutreach programs that engage, educate, \ndevelop and train our diverse suppliers \nand partners are integral to the efforts \nof our team. One of our priorities is \nto ensure that small and diverse busi-\nnesses have the training they need to \ncompete with more established firms. \nFor instance, we help build capacity in \nthe area of sustainability so that a lack of \nknowledge in that area doesn\u2019t become \na roadblock to completing our CRQ or \nother requirements for working with Citi. \nDuring 2019, we collaborated with the \nNew York & New Jersey Minority Supplier \nDevelopment Council to host the ninth \nannual Sustainability Symposium in New \nYork City. The agenda included a focus \non the integration of the UN Sustainable \nDevelopment Goals into standard \nbusiness practices, a workshop with the \nUN Global Compact to educate diverse \nfirms about the business implications of \nmodern slavery as well as a panel focused \non ratings and reporting.\n\nTo further build the capacity of diverse \nsuppliers, we host events in different \nlocations around the world to share \ninformation and best practices for \ndoing business with Citi and other large \ncompanies.

In 1975, the rise in popularity of \nATMs prompted us to establish a research center exploring consumer behavior \nand interactions with these machines. From there, our interest in how technol-\nogy both influences customer expectations and has a positive impact on their \nexperiences with our bank has only grown. \n\nIn 2009, we opened our first Citi Innovation Lab in Dublin, Ireland, with the \naim of understanding how advancements in technology would impact our \nclients\u2019 expectations as well as our business models and treasury operations. \nIn the decade since, our Innovation Lab model has evolved to keep pace with \ntechnological advancements, the direction of our business and the needs of \nour clients. We started with a single lab that operated independently from our \nbusiness and was focused on Citi-oriented solutions. Today our Innovation \nLab network has grown to five labs globally. Not only are these labs now more \nintegrated with our core business \u2014 enabling greater innovation throughout \nour organization \u2014 they also partner with fintech firms to bring new solutions \nto scale from concept through execution. \n\nIn the last 10 years, technological innovation has led to new ways of doing \nbusiness as well as completely new business models based on e-commerce, \nconnected systems and real-time dynamics. The two-way channel between \nour labs and our business enables collaboration and a free exchange of ideas, \nhelping us find cutting-edge solutions and often co-creating with our clients to \naddress the unique challenges they face. \n\nAs we move forward, our Labs are considering how business models will \nchange in the coming years as demographics shift, the needs and activities \nof our clients evolve and technology continues to develop at a rapid pace. \nCiti currently has Innovation Labs in England, Ireland, Israel, Mexico and \nSingapore.\n\nservices. Since 2010, Citi Ventures has \ninvested in more than 40 startups and \nhas helped to pilot or commercialize more \nthan 60 percent of those startups within \nCiti. The team\u2019s current portfolio includes \ncompanies that are leading the way in \ninvestment platforms, digital infrastruc-\nture, fintech, commerce and payments. \n\nIn addition to investing in startups, Citi \nVentures advances innovation through \nthree complementary focus areas.\n\n \u2022 Through our D10X\u00ae program, we \n\nempower our employees to build, test \nand launch new solutions that are \nexponentially better for our clients. \nThis approach helps us accelerate \nlearning and bring more certainty to \nwhere we should \u2014 or should not \u2014 \ninvest resources. \n\n \u2022 Our Emerging Technology team \n\nmonitors new solutions that offer the \ngreatest potential to transform the \nlives of people, businesses and com-\nmunities. Working closely with Citi \ncolleagues and the external innova-\ntion ecosystem, we learn, engage and \nexperiment. This is critical as we look \nto upskill our workforce and prepare \nboth our employees and our clients \nfor the next decade.\n\n \u2022 Our Studio team, which launched \n\nin 2018, collaborates with Citi \ncolleagues internally and engages \nwith the broader, external digital \ninnovation ecosystem to understand \nthe macro trends affecting economic \nvitality for people, businesses and \ncities and to incubate solutions. The \nteam identifies areas where Citi can \ndrive change and help communities \nthrive, specifically looking at the \nfuture of work, inclusive entrepre-\nneurship and city competitiveness. \n\nThrough these efforts and others across \nCiti, we collaborate on breakthrough \nideas that originate outside of our \ncompany and support innovation from \n\n87\n\n\f##PAGE_BREAK##Contents \n\n  Our Approach to ESG \n\n  Solutions for Impact \n\n  How We Do Business \n\n  Appendices             \n\nwithin \u2014 thereby incubating new solutions \nand products that support our mission of \ngrowth and economic progress. \n\nEmpowering Financial \nSecurity and Strengthening \nCommunities \n\nIn 2019, Citi Ventures invested in, built \nand launched a range of products and \nservices that improve financial security \nfor consumers and support community \ndevelopment. One such investment is \nDigit \u2014 an app that analyzes users\u2019 spend-\ning habits and helps them save money. \nDigit connects to an individual\u2019s checking \naccount and uses advanced algorithms \nthat look at historical transaction behav-\nior and use predictive technology to \ndetermine the optimal amount of money \nto save each day. It then automatically \nmoves that money into a separate \naccount. This automation helps users \nbetter understand their financial health \nand save money without thinking about \nit so they can reach their goals and feel \nmore financially secure. The Citi Ventures \nteam partnered with Digit in 2019 to help \nthem build their business and scale their \nsolutions. \n\nSimilarly, Citi Venture\u2019s D10X program \nsupported an internal team of employees \nto develop a solution that helps consum-\ners track their spending and manage \ntheir finances. This app \u2014 called Beacon \nby Citi \u2014 tracks everyday expenses such \nas eating out, buying coffee, taking taxis \nor buying groceries and then provides \ncustomized activities based on each \nperson\u2019s spending habits to encourage \nbehavior change. Both Digit and Beacon \nby Citi are available to everyone via the \nApp Store and Google Play, regardless of \nwhether they are Citi customers. \n\nIn addition to tools that help individuals \nmanage their personal finances, we also \ncontribute to solutions that support the \nfinancial health of entire communities. In \n2019, we launched City Builder by CitiSM, \na data-driven platform for investors and \nfunds to explore place-based investments, \n\n88\n\nAccelerating the  \nIdentification of Assets  \nfor Green Bonds\n\nGreen bonds are debt instruments whose proceeds \ngo toward financing or refinancing projects that meet \ncertain environmental or climate-aligned criteria. \nOne challenge of green bonds is that they require \ncompanies to identify new projects or green assets on \ntheir balance sheets for the bonds to fund. This is often \na slow, manual process, which can discourage large \ncompanies from attempting to secure green bonds. \n\nIn 2019, one of our employee-led D10X \nteams developed and piloted a new plat-\nform in partnership with Microsoft that \nuses machine learning to automate this \ntime-intensive process \u2014 rapidly scanning \nbalance sheet data to identify potential \ngreen assets and suggesting financing or \nrefinancing structures. This cloud-based \nservice also has the potential to help \ninstitutional investors and asset managers \ntrack their green bond investments, learn \nmore about their portfolio and provide \nimpact reporting. \n\nAfter successful internal tests, Citi \nis exploring piloting the service with \npublic-sector clients, including develop-\nment banks. We will use insights from  \nthe pilot to refine and improve the plat-\nform, with the goal of making green bonds \na more accessible option for companies  \nand large issuers with extensive or \ncomplex balance sheets.  \n\nCiti 2019 ESG Report\f##PAGE_BREAK##identify local investment needs and gain \nvaluable insights into the potential social \nimpact of investments in affordable \nhousing, job creation, youth services and \nmore. City Builder by Citi is currently \nfocused on supporting community impact \ninvestments in U.S. Opportunity Zones, \naggregating census data and real estate \ninsights to present a comprehensive view \nof the needs and opportunities within \neach city. \n\nInvesting in Tech Talent\n\nIn addition to supporting entrepreneurs \nand innovative companies, we also invest \nin the passionate, skilled employees \nwithin Citi who know our business, \nknow our clients and have their own \ngroundbreaking ideas that can benefit \ncustomers. And we look to attract future \ntech talent by developing meaningful \nprograms that pave the way for the next \ngeneration of leaders. \n\nOur D10X program, powered by Citi \nVentures, is one way we foster innovation \ninternally and encourage new ideas \nacross our businesses. Through this \nmodel, we engage our employees and \npartner with our clients to develop, vali-\ndate, test and deploy innovations quickly \nand effectively. Employees test their \nhypotheses and refine their approaches \nthrough direct contact with clients. \nGrounded in the principles of venture \ncapital and in Lean Startup methodology, \nparticipating employees are coached \nand championed by seasoned, in-house \ncoaches through each step of the process \n\u2014 from ideation to pitching and validating \nideas to launching solutions into the \nmarket. Examples of projects in devel-\nopment during 2019 include the Beacon \nby Citi app and cloud-based green assets \nas a service platform, both mentioned \nearlier. Since the program\u2019s inception in \n2016, more than 2,800 employees have \nbeen involved with D10X, and we have \ntested nearly 300 new ideas.\n\nAnother important part of our innovation \nstrategy involves engaging with diverse \nemerging talent. Through Citi\u00ae University \nPartnerships in Innovation & Discovery \n(CUPID), launched in 2018, Citi embeds \nstudents from leading universities in \ninnovation activities across the company. \nThe students gain exposure to various \naspects of Citi\u2019s businesses while helping \nto solve complex, real-world challenges \nwith cutting-edge solutions for clients \nand communities. \n\nCUPID emphasizes an interdisciplin-\nary, collaborative approach, seeking \nout talent beyond business graduate \nprograms to include individuals studying \ndesign, engineering and public policy. \nRather than taking a one-size-fits-all \napproach, we match students in the \nprogram with innovation-focused \ninternships that fit their interests, \ngoals and skills.

Among other findings, the report asserts that to meet the future \nneeds of their organizations, businesses must support the reskilling and \nupskilling of their current workforces (beyond just those employees already \nperforming in-demand jobs). Furthermore, the report found that as the \nworkforce changes rapidly, the window to proactively manage this change \nis closing. Unfortunately, rather than embracing this window of opportunity, \nmany employers are focusing their upskilling efforts on a narrow set of \nalready highly skilled, highly valued employees.1\n\nIn this context of a rapidly changing world and a workforce that is transform-\ning along with it, Citi is providing our employees with access to resources \nthat help them build digital skills, enabling them to take advantage of oppor-\ntunities within our company. Through the online platform Degreed, we offer \nemployees learning pathways on digital awareness and digital acumen. These \ncurated collections of resources \u2014 including courses, videos, articles and \nother tools \u2014 help employees gain an understanding of the digital world and \nprovide insight into the latest technology trends, how they impact Citi and \nwhat our company is doing in response. The resources cover a wide range \nof topics, including machine learning, artificial intelligence, cryptocurrency, \nextended reality, and agile and robotic process automation. Employees can \ncomplement this coursework by joining an online collaboration community \nwhere they share knowledge and best practices with their colleagues about \nthe skills required for the future of work. \n\nIn addition, our Citi Ventures Emerging Technology team engages with stake-\nholders inside and outside of Citi to understand technological breakthroughs \non the horizon. The team uses this knowledge to push Citi\u2019s collective under-\nstanding forward and develops learning packs to educate Citi employees \nabout next-generation technologies, opportunities within the current market \nand how their skills could be used in the future. \n\nCustomer-Centric \nSolutions\n\nThe success of our business depends on \nbalancing the needs of all our customers. \nThis means that while we maintain our \nphysical branches and analog processes \nfor our customers who depend on them \n\u2014 a sizable and important portion of our \ncustomer base \u2014 we are also investing in \nand advancing digital solutions, which we \nsee as our biggest opportunity for future \ngrowth. Our Global Consumer Banking \nbusiness has reshaped itself in recent \nyears to become even more customer- \ncentric, with a focus on digital solutions \nthat meet customers where they are and \nrespond to the ways they want to engage \nwith us. A growing number of customers \nexpect digital innovation that provides \nease and convenience in accessing finan-\ncial information and empowers them to \nmanage their money responsibly. \n\nEmpowering Customers \nThrough Digital Platforms\n\nAs more of our customers embrace \nmobile technology, we have evolved to \na mobile-first strategic focus. Some of \nthe most recent updates to our mobile \nbanking app provide practical, convenient \nsolutions that empower customers \nto avoid fraudulent activity on their \naccounts. For instance, customers can \nuse the app to report lost or stolen ATM \nand debit cards and track replacement \ncards, all while monitoring their transac-\ntion history for fraudulent activity. They \ncan also use the geolocation of their \nmobile phones to gauge their proximity \nto their credit cards during point of sale \ntransactions, which reduces the likelihood \nthat a genuine transaction will be inter-\nrupted due to a mistaken fraud alert. \n\nSecure, streamlined solutions are also \nimportant for connecting with new \ncustomers and expanding offerings to our \n\n1  World Economic Forum, The Future of Jobs Report 2018 (Sept. 2018), pages v, vii and 23, http://www3.weforum.org/docs/WEF_Future_of_Jobs_2018.pdf. \n\n90\n\nCiti 2019 ESG Report\f##PAGE_BREAK##existing customers.

For instance, the Citi Virtual Card \nAccount provides a secure, business- \nto-business digital solution for large \nworkflows through the generation of \nunique, nonplastic account numbers. The \nvirtual card technology enables real-time \ntransactions that are automated and \nsecure, safeguarding against fraud and \npotential misuse. The card eliminates the \nneed for paper-based payments but still \nleaves an electronic trace, which allows \nfor easy reconciliation and reporting. \nDuring 2019, we also announced the \n\nCiti Payment Outlier Detection solution. \nThis technology uses analytics, artificial \nintelligence and machine learning to \nfind transactions that don\u2019t align with \ntypical patterns of activity. These outliers \ncan then be investigated to determine \nwhether they indicate fraud. \n\nCiti conducts regular information secu-\nrity risk assessments and has internal \ncontrols to defend against information \nsecurity breaches.

Working with our clients, \ncompetitors, governments, law enforce-\nment and intelligence agencies, we \nshare best practices and conduct joint \ncyber resilience exercises. Our security \nteams also study information security \nchallenges across industries to learn how \nto strengthen our internal practices and \nrespond to problems quickly. \n\nPrivacy\n\nThe fair, ethical and lawful collection, use \nand processing of customers\u2019 personal \ninformation is essential to build trust, \nprovide best-in-class services and achieve \nour corporate objectives. To help meet \nthis goal, Citi has established a dedi-\ncated Chief Privacy Office team led by \na global Chief Privacy Officer. The Chief \nPrivacy Office, part of our Independent \nCompliance Risk Management team, \nmanages the Citi Global Privacy program, \nwhich is overseen by the Citi Global \n\nPrivacy Committee. The program \nprovides a framework for managing \nprivacy and confidentiality risks for the \ncompany.\n\nCiti\u2019s Privacy and Confidentiality Policy \narticulates principles relating to the \ncollection and processing of personal \ninformation, requiring, in part, that \npersonal information only be collected \nand used as necessary for the perfor-\nmance of the services offered and for the \npurposes disclosed in a privacy notice. \nCiti is transparent in our collection and \nuse practices and offers customers \nchoices with respect to how their \npersonal information may be collected \nor otherwise used (as required by law), \nincluding opting out of marketing or \nother communications or reviewing and \ncorrecting information.

In the coming years, part-\nnerships will be critical as we collaborate \nto bring innovations to scale, expand \nfinancial inclusion through digital \nsolutions, strengthen our business and \nrespond to the changing expectations of \nour clients and customers with agility and \nexpertise. \n\nAs reliance on digital technologies \naccelerates, it is imperative that we \nremain knowledgeable of the latest \nadvancements and the related implica-\ntions for our business and our clients and \ncustomers, including safeguarding digital \nidentities, the ethical use of artificial \nintelligence and the opportunities offered \nby blockchain, to name a few. Digital \nadvancements affect every aspect of our \nbusiness, so we will continue to engage \nour employees with resources that help \nthem acquire and hone the skills essential \nto their success at Citi and, by extension, \nour success in the marketplace. \n\n95\n\nProtecting Digital Identity\n\nOur digital identities are a critical aspect of our \nmodern lives and integral to many financial products \nand services. With this, we face the ongoing threat of \nidentity theft and cyberattacks that can undermine \nthe security of our personal information. As a result, \npeople often wonder how to take full advantage of \ndigital solutions while protecting their privacy and \nsafeguarding their data, especially as they grow weary \nof complex authentication requirements and the need \nto remember an ever-growing list of passwords and \nuser IDs. \n\nFor financial institutions such as Citi, \nverifying our customers\u2019 identity is \nfundamental to safeguarding their finan-\ncial assets and protecting their privacy. \nOur aim is to deliver solutions that \nprovide seamless, intuitive interactions \nwith digital tools that won\u2019t compromise \npersonal data. To provide ongoing train-\ning for our employees, we have created \ndigital identity learning packs that help \nbuild awareness of and skills related \nto new digital identity technologies. In \naddition, in 2019 we hosted an event \ncalled The Future of Digital Identity that \nengaged clients, partners, startups and \nCiti employees. Regardless of the varying \nperspectives the panelists brought to \nthe event, there was consensus that data \nprivacy and protection are central to \nadvancements in digital identity. Their \nassessment was that regulations around \nthe world and increased attention on \n\nprivacy rights are elevating the need \nfor more end-user control over personal \ninformation. \n\nWe are seeing advancements in decen-\ntralized identity that provide efficient \nsolutions that are more secure than \ntraditional, centralized models and less \ncumbersome than maintaining multiple \nIDs and passwords. During 2019, Citi \nparticipated in a digital identity project \nwith external partners to explore new \ndecentralized approaches enabled by \nblockchain technology that build trust \nto create a secure exchange of informa-\ntion between unknown parties. We will \ncontinue to explore the latest trends and \ntechnology in this cutting-edge space, \nwhile working to implement secure, \nuser-friendly solutions that meet our \ncustomers\u2019 needs. \n\n\f##PAGE_BREAK##Contents \n\n  Our Approach to ESG \n\n  Solutions for Impact \n\n  How We Do Business \n\n  Appendices             \n\nTalent and Diversity\n\nHIGHLIGHTS\n\nPay equity transparency\nPublicly shared our raw pay gap in 2019, \nwith continued pay equity transparency \nin early 2020\nPage 97\n\nEquality Act\nSupported the proposed Equality Act, \nfederal legislation that would provide \nprotections to LGBT+ people\nPage 101\n\nPaid leave\nExpanded our Paid Parental Leave Policy \nto every kind of family, everywhere we \noperate\nPage 111\n\nAt Citi, we actively seek out diverse perspectives at  \nall levels of our organization because we know that it  \nwill improve performance and boost innovation and  \nengagement. Over the last two years, we have elevated \nthe conversation around race, gender and equal pay for \nequal work. Our increased transparency, which in turn \nbreeds accountability and credibility, is a force for  \nchange both inside and outside our company.

This \n\n96\n\nCiti 2019 ESG Report\f##PAGE_BREAK##feedback, viewed with a demographic \nlens, helps us better understand where \nwe need to focus.\n\nOur Diversity \nPriorities \nPay Equity\n\nIn the U.S., women make less than men, \nand women of color take home less than \nwhite women. Worldwide, women hold \nonly about one-third of corporate lead-\nership positions. Businesses have been \nworking for decades to advance gender \nequality in the workplace, but progress \nhas been slow and results disappointing.\n\nAt Citi, we\u2019ve pushed ourselves beyond \nour comfort zone \u2014 not just to acknowl-\nedge the stark realities laid bare in the \nstatistics around pay equity, but also to \nrecognize the social and cultural forces \nthat produced them. We are being open \nabout our data, what it means and what \nneeds to be done to meet our goals.\n\nIn 2019, we disclosed that, on an adjusted \nbasis, women globally are paid on \naverage more than 99 percent of what \n\nmen are paid at Citi, and there was no \nstatistically significant difference in \nadjusted compensation for U.S. minori-\nties and nonminorities. Following our \nreview, we once again made appropriate \npay adjustments as part of our annual \ncompensation cycle.  \n\nWe also made a decision to be transpar-\nent about a statistic that our CEO has \ndescribed as \u201cdisappointing\u201d and \u201cugly\u201d: \nour unadjusted or \u201craw\u201d pay gap1 for \nwomen and U.S. minorities. The analysis \nshowed that Citi\u2019s median pay for women \nglobally is 71 percent of the median for \nmen and that the median pay for U.S. \nminorities is 93 percent of the median \nfor nonminorities. An updated analysis \nreleased in early 2020 found those \nnumbers had moved slightly, but in the \nright direction, to 73 percent for women \nand 94 percent for U.S. minorities. For \nour company, the data reaffirms the \nimportance of goals we announced in \n2018 to increase our representation of \nwomen and U.S. minorities in senior and \nhigher-paying roles at Citi. (See more on \npage 98.) We know that is the only effec-\ntive way for us to meaningfully reduce \nour raw pay gap over time.\n\n1  The raw pay gap is the difference between the median pay for all female employees and the median pay for all male \n\nemployees at Citi, and the difference between the median pay for minorities and nonminorities, not accounting for \ndifferences in factors such as job function, level or geography.\n\nRadical transparency \ncertainly makes you \n\nuncomfortable, but it\u2019s \nimportant to get out of the \nold habits.

As \npeople come in and out of the firm, as our \ncolleagues are promoted and as market \ndynamics change, these reviews serve as \nimportant measures of how we\u2019re doing \non our commitment to pay colleagues \nequitably for their work and of the prog-\nress we\u2019re making to increase diversity  \nat more senior levels at Citi.\n\nRepresentation Goals\n\nWe have set representation goals to \nincrease diversity across the firm and \nhave focused our efforts on three key \nareas: targeted recruitment, development \nand retention, and promotion paths and \nprocesses. At a minimum, by the end of \n2021, we plan to improve the representa-\ntion of women in assistant vice president \nto managing director level roles to at \nleast 40 percent globally, up from  \n37 percent when we set the goals in 2018, \nand to boost the representation of Black \nemployees in those same roles in the  \nU.S. to at least 8 percent, up from the  \n6 percent 2018 baseline. Senior leaders \nat Citi were involved in the development \nof the goals and are now measured on \ntheir progress against them, just as they \nare for other business priorities.\n\nAs we work toward these goals, we are \ngaining valuable insight into the internal \nand external roadblocks that can make \ngrowing the pipeline of diverse talent \nand expanding diversity at senior levels \nchallenging \u2014 challenges that are shared \nacross many industries. As we learn, \nwe are able to implement changes that \nensure we sustainably move the needle \non our diversity metrics while supporting \nrepresentation across all diverse groups \nglobally. \n\nSome have raised concerns that increas-\ning the focus on diversity and inclusion \nruns contrary to the idea of creating a \ntrue meritocracy. However, the myth of \nmeritocracy is that a level playing field, \nwhere there is equal opportunity for all \nto succeed, already exists. But, the most \n\nrecent data from the National Center \nfor Education Statistics shows that \nwomen make up 47 percent of people \nreceiving graduate degrees from U.S. \nbusiness schools. Yet the percentage of \nwomen who run Fortune 500 compa-\nnies declined in 2018 to 4.8 percent, \ndown from 6.4 percent the prior year. \nSuch outcomes reinforce how deeply \nrooted and systemic these challenges \nare. Advantages are available to some \nbecause of their socioeconomic, \nacademic or cultural background, and \nreflecting a true meritocracy requires \nthat we eliminate the imbalance of \nwomen and minorities in our workforce \nby working to actually level the  \nplaying field. \n\nThese representation goals, as well as \nother work we are doing around gender \nequality in the workplace, directly \ncontribute to SDG 5 in support of  \ngender equality and empowering all \nwomen and girls. Specifically, we are \nenabling progress toward target 5.5, \nwhich aims to ensure women\u2019s full and \neffective participation and equal oppor-\ntunities for leadership at all levels of \ndecision-making in political, economic \nand public life. \n\nSDG Goal 5: Gender Equality \n\nInclusive Leadership \n\nWe engage our colleagues in creative \nways to help them understand the \nimportance of inclusive leadership at \n\nCiti and address unconscious bias and \nworkplace micro-inequities head on. We \nkicked off 2019 with our second annual \nTogether at Citi: Building an Inclusive \nCulture event in which our CEO and our \nAffinity group leaders engaged employ-\nees in a robust discussion on inclusive \nleadership, transparency and belonging. \nThis session was complemented by four \nregional sessions on building an inclusive \nculture that were led by senior executives \nand Dr. Binna Kandola, co-founder of the \nbusiness psychology firm Pearn Kandola. \nIn these sessions, which engaged 8,500 \ncolleagues, participants heard anecdotes \nfrom real employees about their personal \nexperiences with micro-inequities and the \nimpact those experiences have had on \nthem in the workplace. Participants also \nlearned strategies for building awareness \nof and mitigating micro-inequities.\n\nIn addition, we trained more than 4,500 \nhiring managers and Human Resources \ncolleagues to recognize and call out \npotential unconscious biases in their \npeople decisions. We have created inter-\nactive sessions to recognize common \nunconscious biases and hold one another \naccountable to calling these out when we \nsee them.   \n\nIn July, New York University School of \nLaw Professor Kenji Yoshino presented \nhis research on \u201ccovering\u201d \u2014 i.e., down-\nplaying our outsider attributes in order to \nblend into the mainstream \u2014 at Citi\u2019s New \nYork headquarters.

The challenges participants identified included the need \nfor a better way to connect to peers to share best practices; a desire for more easily  \naccessible tools to address management questions; and a demand for digital resources \nthat curate the most relevant information new managers need as they transition to their \nnew roles. Based on our findings, we have launched a new program called Welcome to Citi \nManagement that brings together new managers to address these shared challenges in \nan interactive, participant-driven format, and provides them with a digital \u201cplacemat\u201d that \nputs a range of essential resources at their fingertips. \n\ncybersecurity to effective communication \nskills.

Our Global Consumer Operations \nprograms help high-performing employ-\nees build the skills needed to transition \nto manager and supervisory roles, and \n80 percent of participants have been \npromoted or are on a promotion path.\n\nOur Global Associate Learning Initiative \nis a nine-month training program aimed \nat Institutional Client Group employees \nat the associate level \u2014 a critical mile-\nstone early in an employee\u2019s career. The \nprogram, which combines digital learning \nwith in-person training, prepares the \nnext generation of Citi leadership for the \nfuture of banking. In 2019, we hosted 450 \nglobal associates (representing 40  \ncountries and 50 cities) at our New York \nheadquarters for the inaugural event. \n\nEvaluation\n\nEmployees receive formal feedback from \ntheir managers through midyear and \nyear-end reviews. Our two-rating system \nevaluates employee performance against \ntheir goals and assesses their leadership \nthrough the lens of our Leadership \nStandards. Citi also encourages employ-\nees and their managers to create indi-\nvidual development plans that consider \nthe skills, strategic training opportunities \nand behaviors needed to enhance current \nperformance and prepare for future \nroles. These plans are created as part \nof midyear and year-end reviews, and \nemployees are able to use digital and \nin-person training resources to execute \ntheir development plans and enhance \ntheir skills.  \n\nBeginning in 2019, all Citi employees have \nthe ability to request feedback from and \nprovide feedback to colleagues in real \ntime, while managers can also ask for \nfeedback on team members throughout \nthe year. In addition, more than 2,700 \nmanagers who participated in training \nprograms received a 360-degree perfor-\nmance review, which is designed to help \nidentify opportunities for development.\n\n109\n\nCiti 2019 ESG Report\f##PAGE_BREAK##Promotion Paths  \nand Processes\n\nA critical part of guiding our employ-\nees\u2019 career progressions is working to \nbetter understand what works and what \ndoesn\u2019t so we can not only retain but \nalso promote our talent. Career devel-\nopment is an important priority, and we \npromote from within wherever possible. \nIn 2019, 38 percent of open positions \nwere filled internally. This focus is partic-\nularly important for our diverse talent \nas we work to increase representation \nat more senior levels of the company. \nFor example, with immense focus and \ncontinued investment in development, \nmore than 28 percent of our Citi Country \nOfficers (our country business heads) \nare female, and our ultimate goal is to \nincrease this to 50 percent. \n\nWe have been focused on equipping \nmanagers to better anticipate and learn \nabout employee concerns and to partner \nto develop solutions that help them \nretain and promote key talent. Managers \nare encouraged and supported to look \nbeyond formal talent review conver-\nsations to have candid conversations, \n\nVoice of the Employee\nOur annual Voice of the Employee survey gathers critical input on trends in the work-\nplace and management practices, serving as an important catalyst for implementing \nchange within our company. All employees are invited to participate and have their \nvoices heard. \n\nIn 2019, the survey\u2019s Engagement Index \u2014 which measures employees\u2019 sentiments \nregarding opportunities for growth, job alignment with skills and perception that the \ncompany is making the changes necessary to compete \u2014 came in at 76 percent, the \nsame as in 2018.\n\nWe also measure sentiments about diversity.

Through this \nprogram, senior Citi managers increase \ntheir network of potential talent, in part \nby meeting with high-potential talent \nbefore there is a job opening. When \nthere is an opening, internal referrals \ncomplement recommendations from the \nCiti alumni network and search firms, and \nCiti maintains contact with candidates, \nincluding those who are internal, through \na cadence of in-person and virtual  \ncheck-ins.\n\nWe also maintain an employee nomina-\ntion guide for managers, which can be \nused to help identify employees for open \nroles, development programs, special \nassignments and promotions. The guide \naims to reinforce effective practices for \nfair, balanced and inclusive promotion \ndecisions.\n\nWorkforce Well-Being \n\nMaintaining a culture of well-being for our \nemployees is critical to our success. We \ncontinually evaluate the tools and policies \navailable to maintain the well-being of our \nglobal workforce. \n\nWork/Life Balance\n\nCiti realizes the importance of being \nflexible on how, when and where work \ngets done. We have a variety of programs \nthat help employees balance their work \nand life, including both formal and infor-\nmal remote work arrangements and flex \nschedules. Providing opportunities for \nflextime, compressed workweeks, job \nsharing and reduced schedules improves \nemployee satisfaction and retention while \nincreasing productivity. \n\nOur Minds at Citi initiative aims to destig-\nmatize and address issues of mental \nhealth. While specific resources can vary \nby country, we provide access to free and \nconfidential counseling and life coaching \nsessions. The program enables employ-\nees to seek support for a wide range of \n\npersonal issues, such as stress, relation-\nship conflicts and financial challenges, \nas well as workplace challenges, such \nas communicating with managers and \ndealing with organizational change. In the \nUK, Australia and New Zealand, we offer \nmental health training to help managers \nrecognize when employees may be expe-\nriencing issues that impact their mental \nhealth and to provide guidance on how \nto respond and offer support. We are \nworking to expand such efforts to the U.S. \nAs we strive to create a culture in which \neveryone feels supported and valued, \nwe recognize that mental well-being and \nphysical health must both be supported. \n\nIn 2019, we started offering enhanced \nmental health benefits for employees and \ntheir families, including telemedicine- \nbased behavioral health options, on-site \nmental health professionals at our \nlargest locations, and Sleepio, a behavior \nmodification therapy program designed \nto build better sleep habits and improve \nmental health. And, through our learning \nand development efforts, we offer oppor-\ntunities to learn about mental health and \nstrategies for helping others who might \nbe affected. \n\nIn the U.S., our on-site medical clinics \nprovide healthcare, free preventative \nscreenings and health promotion \nprograms, immunizations and pre-travel \nhealth guidance to all employees. \nThese initiatives help employees and \ntheir families achieve their health goals \nthrough resources that are free, easy to \nuse and available to employees whether \nor not they are enrolled in a Citi health \nplan. Our Live Well Rewards program in \nthe U.S. enables employees and their \nspouses or partners who are enrolled \nin our medical plans to earn up to $450 \n($900 for a couple) in Live Well Rewards \njust for practicing healthy behaviors such \nas tracking their exercise, participating in \nbiometric screenings or taking an online \ncourse in how to lose weight or start an \nexercise program. More than 57,000 \nemployees in the U.S. earned Live Well \nRewards in 2019. Rewards are offered in \n\nthe form of gift cards to popular retailers. \nOur locations in the U.S. and Mexico are \ntobacco-free. \n\nWe also offer a Health Advocate program \nin the U.S., separate from insurance \nprograms, to aid employees in resolving \ninsurance claims, accessing medical \nspecialists and addressing their health \nneeds and those of their families. We also \nconsider how our buildings can affect our \nemployees. From providing ergonomic \nfurniture to managing air and acoustics, \nwe strive to create an environment that \nsupports the well-being and productivity \nof our employees. Learn more about how \nphysical space impacts employee well- \nbeing in the Operations and Supply Chain \nsection. Also, our Save Well plans guide \nour employees in building financial stabil-\nity and saving for retirement, and we \noffer a tuition reimbursement option for \ncertain employees going back to school. \n\nCiti Benefits and  \nFamily Life\n\nSupporting employees in their family life \nis an important part of workforce well- \nbeing. We believe all parents deserve \ntime to adjust to parenthood and bond \nwith the newest members of their fami-\nlies. That\u2019s why we recently expanded \nour Paid Parental Leave Policy to include \nCiti employees around the world. The \nnew policy, which began rolling out in \nearly 2020, applies to every kind of \nfamily and includes a new parental paid \nleave minimum everywhere we operate. \nAt a minimum, all Citi employees will be \neligible for 16 weeks of paid maternity \nleave and four weeks of paid parental \nleave. Maternity leave applies to all birth-\ning parents while parental leave covers \nall nonbirthing parents, regardless of \ngender or type of birth (e.g., adoption or \nsurrogacy). \n\nEmployees working in countries that offer \nlonger periods of paid leave time will \ncontinue to maintain their benefits.\n\n111\n\nCiti 2019 ESG Report\f##PAGE_BREAK##We recognize that our parental leave \nbenefit only adds value if our employees \nactually take the time that is offered to \nthem. We know that some new parents \nmay be reluctant to take time off after \nadding to their families, and we aim to \nfoster a culture that supports employees \nin making this decision. \n\nWe also offer employees discounts for \ndependent care, and we provide a new \nparent program for both men and women \nas they navigate the transition to parent-\nhood. In addition, we offer the Bright \nHorizons Special Needs program, which \nprovides online resources for parents in \nthe U.S. with special needs children and \nsubsidized dependent care when work-\n|related issues disrupt regular schedules. \nWe also offer a college coach to help \nfamilies and their children navigate the \npost-secondary education admissions \nprocess. In addition, we have policies for \nemployees who require paid time off for \nreasons such as military or medical leave.\n\nVolunteerism \n\nWe offer our employees resources and \ntools to volunteer in the communities in \nwhich they live and work, and, in turn, \nour employees are proud to contribute to \nhelping individuals and families thrive. \n\nIn 2019, Citi employee volunteers contrib-\nuted more than 1 million volunteer hours \nin communities around the world.  \nOur colleagues used their professional \nskills, expertise and time volunteering \nwith community organizations to support \na range of projects, from traditional \nhands-on activities to skills-based volun-\nteering. These employee engagement \nefforts with community organizations \noften complement financial support \nfrom Citi and the Citi Foundation. To help \nencourage employee engagement in \ncommunities, every active and qualified \nCiti employee is entitled to one paid day \neach year to volunteer with an eligible \nnonprofit organization of their choice.\n\nWhile Citi employees volunteer year-\nround, Global Community Day, our annual \nday of service for employees, friends and \nfamily, is an important way in which we \ncollectively deepen relationships with our \ncommunities. In 2019, 120,000 volunteers \nparticipated in more than 1,500 events \nheld in 400 cities across 90 countries. \nSince the inaugural Global Community \nDay in 2006, Citi volunteers have \ncontributed more than 4 million hours of \nservice to projects in hundreds of cities. \nWe also track how Global Community Day \nevents are helping to advance the UN \nSustainable Development Goals. \n\nFair Employment  \nPractices\n\nWe strive to maintain an environment \nin which opportunities to develop are \nwidely available, where people are hired \nand advanced on their merits and where \nour employees treat each other with \nrespect. We are fully committed to equal \nemployment opportunity and comply \nwith the letter and spirit of all laws \nregarding fair employment practices and \nnondiscrimination. \n\nFor more information on fair employment \npractices, see the Human Rights section \nof this report as well as our Code of \nConduct. \n\nCompensation\n\nWe offer competitive salaries based on \nour Compensation Philosophy, which \noutlines our five primary objectives (see \nbox on on page 113). Our approach to \ncompensation includes ensuring that \nentry-level employees receive compet-\nitive wages within the industry, and in \nJune, we raised our minimum wage in \nthe U.S. to $15 per hour. We also offer \nemployees the opportunity to take advan-\ntage of formal or informal flexible work \narrangements, including part-time work \nand job sharing. \n\nWe conduct a robust annual review of \ncompensation, which includes multiple \nlayers of reviews of compensation \nrecommendations and pay equity anal-\nysis. Learn more about our pay equity \nanalysis. \n\nExecutive Compensation\n\nWe compensate our executives fairly, \nbased on individual and company \nperformance, competitive benchmarking \nand support of our Mission and Value \nProposition. Our Proxy Statement \ncontains a scorecard with each named \nexecutive officer\u2019s financial and \nnonfinancial performance goals, which \nare approved by the Board\u2019s Personnel \nand Compensation Committee. We seek \nto design our executive pay program to \nmotivate balanced behaviors consistent \nwith our focus on long-term strategic \ngoals. For example, diversity and inclu-\nsion, including increasing the represen-\ntation of women and U.S. minorities, and \nethics and culture are incorporated into \nsenior executives\u2019 scorecards, which are a \nfactor in remuneration. Citi incorporates \nshareholder and stakeholder input on \nexecutive pay into our Compensation \nPhilosophy. We apply our Compensation \nPhilosophy through our Executive \nCompensation Framework, which enables \nincentive compensation awards to \nclosely reflect our pay-for-performance \napproach. \n\nDiscrimination and  \nSexual Harassment  \nin the Workplace\n\nCiti strictly prohibits any form of unlawful \ndiscrimination or harassment, as set forth \nin our widely disseminated and consis-\ntently enforced policies. Employees who \nbelieve they have been discriminated \nagainst or harassed are encouraged to \nreport any incidents that violate Citi\u2019s pol-\nicies to their managers, another member \nof the employee\u2019s management chain, \nHuman Resources, or the Ethics Hotline. \n\n112\n\n\f##PAGE_BREAK##Contents \n\n  Our Approach to ESG \n\n  Solutions for Impact \n\n  How We Do Business \n\n  Appendices             \n\nCiti employee participating in \nVolunteer Africa in Kenya\n\nService and Skills\n\nAmong our volunteer opportunities, we provide immersive experiences that \nserve as valuable professional and personal development for our employees \nand important retention tools for Citi. They also contribute to our commitment \nto engaging with the communities where we live and work. These opportunities \ninclude the following: \n\nCariClub: Since 2017, CariClub has been \nhelping Citi bankers engage with their \ncommunities and develop leadership expe-\nrience by serving on nonprofit associate \nboards. Through this external resource, \nmore than 80 Citi colleagues are now \nserving on an associate board or have joined \na young professionals committee, and an \nadditional 80 colleagues will be working \nthrough the process in 2019. Citi offers \nthe program to employees who have been \nwith the firm for three to seven years. Most \nparticipants are between the ages of 25  \nand 35.\n\nService Year: Through a partnership with \nService Year Alliance, select first-year \nCiti analysts in New York City who have \naccepted a full-time offer have the oppor-\ntunity to defer that offer for one year to \nwork in a strategic role at a nonprofit of \ntheir choice. With a guaranteed return to \nCiti after their year of service, partici-\npants contribute their skills and expertise \nto supporting their communities while \nhoning skills that will prove valuable in \ntheir careers at Citi. Since the program\u2019s \ninception in 2016, 32 Citi colleagues have \nparticipated. \n\niMentor: Since the launch of our Pathways \nto Progress program in 2014, the Citi \nFoundation and iMentor have worked \ntogether to equip high school students \nwith the tools to succeed academically and \nprepare for post-secondary education and \ncareer opportunities. In addition to the \nFoundation\u2019s grant funding, more than  \n130 Citi employees across the U.S. served  \nas mentors in 2019, helping to develop \ncollege and career aspirations, assist \nwith the college application and financing \nprocess and coach mentees throughout \ntheir post-secondary academic years.   \n\nVolunteer Africa: Launched in 2016, \nVolunteer Africa connects microentrepre-\nneurs in Africa with Citi employee volun-\nteers from select areas of our business. In \n2019, 24 junior bankers spent five weeks \nin Kenya supporting 16 high-potential \nentrepreneurs to help grow their businesses \nand create much-needed jobs in the local \ncommunity. The entrepreneurs are also able \nto pitch for investment from Citi through \na dedicated fund established by the bank. \nResearch on previous entrepreneurs partic-\nipating in the program in Kenya found that, \non average, entrepreneurs experienced a  \n\n41 percent increase in income and a  \n53 percent increase in profit nine months \nafter completing the program.\n\nOne Young World: As part of the One Young \nWorld program, select Citi employees \nparticipate in a six-month mentorship \nprogram with young social entrepreneurs \nfrom Yunus&Youth, an organization that \npromotes social entrepreneurship by \nconnecting business leaders with the \nnext generation of social entrepreneurs. \nParticipants also attend the annual One \nYoung World Summit, where they debate, \nformulate and share innovative solutions \nfor the world\u2019s most pressing issues and \nbring these ideas back to their work- \nplaces. In 2019, alumni of the program \nconvened a panel of senior executives to \nbring awareness to Citi\u2019s efforts around  \nthe Sustainable Development Goals. An \nadditional 43 colleagues participated in  \nthe program in 2019.  \n\n113\n\nCiti 2019 ESG Report\f##PAGE_BREAK##Upon receipt of any complaint, Citi \npromptly investigates and takes remedial \nmeasures up to and including termination \nof employment, where appropriate.

Citi\u2019s policies also strictly \nprohibit retaliation against any employee \nwho has made a complaint or participated \nin an investigation. For more on our dis-\ncrimination and harassment policies, see \nour Code of Conduct. \n\nIn 2019, we updated our U.S. Workplace \nAnti-Harassment Training Program.

It includes roles and responsi-\nbilities for the identification, reporting, \ninvestigation, resolution and senior \nmanagement reporting of these concerns \nand for oversight of escalation require-\nments and processes. \n\nAs part of Citi\u2019s escalation resources, the \nEthics Hotline provides multiple channels \nfor employees and any third party, includ-\ning members of the general public, to \nreport concerns about unethical behavior \nto Citi\u2019s Ethics Office. In addition to inter-\nnal and public-facing websites facilitating \nthe submission of concerns, a telephone \nline is available 24 hours a day, seven \ndays a week, with live operators who \ncan connect to translators in multiple \nlanguages.\n\nWe believe it is essential that individuals \nfeel secure when raising a concern. All \n\nSpotlight on Ethics \nCiti shares the results of ethics investigations with employees through a quarterly com-\nmunication called the Spotlight on Ethics. This communication is designed to show  \nemployees that their concerns are investigated while highlighting commonplace areas in \nwhich ethical lapses can occur. The Spotlight on Ethics also includes corrective actions \nto demonstrate that speaking up and raising concerns leads to meaningful action. With \ndata security among Citi\u2019s most material environmental, social and governance issues, \n2019 Spotlight communications focused on information security, addressing topics such \nas safeguarding Citi\u2019s network and systems by protecting user IDs and passwords; Citi\u2019s \nprohibition on the use of personal email to conduct Citi business or transmit Citi infor-\nmation; the importance of proper data classification and handling; and the risks posed \nto our network by the downloading of unapproved software and the use of unauthorized \ncode. These communications emphasized that our workforce is on the front line of Citi\u2019s \ninformation security and that each employee has a responsibility to protect and defend \ndata and information entrusted to Citi.  \n\n117\n\nCiti 2019 ESG Report\f##PAGE_BREAK##contacts and investigations are treated \nas confidentially as possible, consistent \nwith the need to investigate and address \nthe matter and subject to applicable laws \nand regulations. Concerns may be raised \neither anonymously or with attribution, \nsubject to applicable laws and regula-\ntions. Further, Citi prohibits any form of \nretaliation against anyone who raises a \nconcern or question in good faith or who \nparticipates in a subsequent investigation. \nEmployees who engage in retaliation \nagainst a colleague because he or she \nraised a concern or question in good faith, \nasked for a reasonable accommodation, \nreported a violation or was involved in an \ninvestigation are subject to disciplinary \naction, up to and including termination  \nof employment or other relationship  \nwith Citi. \n\nEach year, the Citi Ethics Office provides \nto all employees a summary of the types \nof concerns received through the Ethics \nHotline, to show the use of Citi\u2019s Ethics \nHotline process and demonstrate that \nraising concerns to the Citi Ethics Office \nleads to meaningful action within our \norganization. Examples of such action \ncan include disciplinary actions against \nindividual employees and nonemployees; \nthe termination of vendor relationships; \nreferrals to the appropriate law enforce-\nment or governmental authorities; \ncommunications to our workforce; addi-\ntional training for employees and nonem-\nployees; changes to Citi policy, business \nprocesses and procedures; and control \nenhancements. \n\nIndustry Collaboration\n\nWe have made a concerted effort to \npartner with key stakeholders on ways \nthat we can collectively improve the \nculture of the banking industry as well \nas corporate culture overall. In 2019, for \nexample, Citi was one of 181 companies \nwhose chief executive officers signed the \nBusiness Roundtable\u2019s new Statement on \nthe Purpose of a Corporation. As a signa-\ntory, our CEO committed to lead Citi for \nthe benefit of all stakeholders: customers, \n\nReinforcing Our Commitment to  \nEthics from the Top\n\nGlobally, senior Citi leaders have been reinforcing the importance of ethical \ndecision-making. In Mexico, our largest consumer market outside of the U.S., \nand in multiple other countries in Latin America, our senior executives and \ncolleagues engaged in a yearlong campaign to promote ethical decision-making \nand escalation across the organization. Through a senior leadership town hall, \ninternal communications, manager trainings and monthly surveys to validate \nlearning, we worked to foster a collaborative environment in which colleagues \nfeel comfortable talking about ethical dilemmas and asking for advice about \nhow to deal with challenging situations. A similar effort was rolled out in six \ncountries in Asia Pacific, with approximately 7,000 employees participating. \nCiti Country Officers, who are responsible for leading the business in each \nmarket, and their management teams led interactive, face-to-face workshops \nfor employees. By considering how individuals may be able to rationalize \nunethical behaviors, employees engaged in thought-provoking discussions that \nallowed them to better identify these rationalizations and effectively mitigate \nthem. Similar sessions will be rolled out elsewhere in 2020. The Ethical Fitness \nCampaign, launched at the end of 2019, will help to reinforce these efforts. \n\nemployees, suppliers, communities and \nshareholders.\n\nAlso in 2019, Citi\u2019s Chief Innovation \nOfficer and head of Citi Ventures partic-\nipated on a panel at the Federal Reserve \nBank of New York\u2019s annual workshop \non culture and behavior, discussing the \nimpact of new technologies on culture in \nthe workforce. \n\nCiti is also a member of the Banking \nStandards Board (BSB) in the UK. \nTogether with more than 30 other \nmember firms, we support the BSB\u2019s \nindependent role to help rebuild trust \nand confidence across the UK banking \nindustry by promoting high ethical and \nprofessional standards for behavior and \ncompetence. We remain engaged with \nthe BSB directly through our UK senior \nmanagement. Our Chief Country Officer \nfor the UK has been a BSB board member \nsince its inception. \n\nManaging Compliance \nRisk\n\nOur ICRM team helps to drive a culture of \nethical conduct at Citi by establishing poli-\ncies, programs and procedures that guide \nand support our employees in making \nethical decisions and adhering to appro-\npriate standards of conduct. Through an \nintegrated compliance risk management \nframework, this group protects Citi by \nsetting standards; providing guidance, \ntraining and advice to our businesses \nregarding compliance risk; and driving \nownership and accountability for manag-\ning compliance risk in accordance with \nCiti standards across the firm. Managing \ncompliance risk is the responsibility of \nall of our employees and requires not \nonly adherence to applicable laws, regu-\nlations, policies and relevant standards \nof conduct but also the promotion of \n\n118\n\n\f##PAGE_BREAK##Contents \n\n  Our Approach to ESG \n\n  Solutions for Impact \n\n  How We Do Business \n\n  Appendices             \n\nLeadership Standards Accountability\nOur culture is not just who we are and what we believe; it\u2019s how we act in small, \neveryday moments. We encourage all employees to demonstrate the behaviors of our \nLeadership Standards, which are the measurable skills, abilities and knowledge that \nall of us at Citi should exhibit to be successful leaders. Holding ourselves and each \nother to these high standards is part of our culture and our commitment to operating \nin our clients\u2019 best interests, driving economic value and minimizing risk. \n\nWe expect managers to lead by example and inspire their employees to live Citi\u2019s val-\nues. Every manager is responsible for creating a work environment free of discrimina-\ntion, harassment and retaliation. As role models, managers reinforce the importance \nof following our Leadership Standards, Code of Conduct and Mission and Value Propo-\nsition, as well as encourage employees to raise any concerns about potential legal \nor ethical issues. Managers also ensure concerns are properly resolved or promptly \nescalated through appropriate channels, promote awareness of all resources available \nfor reporting concerns and neither engage in nor tolerate retaliation of any kind. \n\nannually \u2014 and in our Code of Conduct, \nwhich summarizes our Anti-Bribery \nPolicy. \n\nCiti complies with all applicable anti- \nbribery laws and regulations, including \nthe U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, \nthe UK Bribery Act and the applicable \nlocal anti-bribery laws of the countries \nin which we operate. Our Anti-Bribery \nProgram Statement expressly prohibits \nbribery in any form for our employees, as \nwell as our suppliers. \n\nWe have written policies, procedures \nand internal controls designed to comply \nwith anti-bribery laws. We conduct an \nannual bribery risk assessment of all \nglobal business lines. The risk assessment \naddresses many areas of risk, including \ngifts and entertainment, hiring practices \nand third-party relationships.  \n\nWe provide our staff with anti-bribery \ntraining annually and supplement it with \ntargeted training and communications \nas needed. We give staff multiple ways, \nincluding the Ethics Hotline, to escalate \n\n \n\nbusiness behavior and activity consistent \nwith the values and conduct expecta-\ntions outlined by our Mission and Value \nProposition, Leadership Standards and \nCode of Conduct. Through the work \nof a range of teams focused on Citi\u2019s \nanti-corruption efforts \u2014 including Anti-\nBribery, Anti-Money Laundering (AML), \nSanctions and the Ethics Office \u2014 we \nwork to counteract the many and varied \nthreats of corruption facing the financial \nsector. Citi\u2019s global Compliance organiza-\ntion is headed by our Chief Compliance \nOfficer, who reports directly to our CEO \nand provides regular reports on the \nperformance of the compliance program, \nincluding in regard to Anti-Bribery, Anti-\nMoney Laundering and Sanctions, to our \nBoard of Directors or a committee of the \nBoard, as appropriate. \n\nAnti-Bribery Program \n\nWe continually enhance our Anti-Bribery \nProgram with respect to the areas \noutlined in the Citi Anti-Bribery Program \nStatement \u2014 which is updated at least \n\n119\n\nbribery-related concerns and to prompt \ninvestigations, where necessary. \n\nSanctions Program\n\nCiti conducts business and operations \nin compliance with applicable sanctions, \nlaws and regulations, including those of \nthe U.S. and other countries in which we \noperate. We maintain a robust, risk-based \nICRM Sanctions Program that applies \nglobally and is commensurate with our \nglobal footprint. As a financial institution \norganized in the U.S., Citi and our subsid-\niaries globally comply with applicable U.S. \nsanctions requirements, among other \nrequirements. \n\nOur enterprise-wide Sanctions Program \npromotes compliance with increasingly \ndynamic sanctions requirements. The \nprogram includes policies and proce-\ndures, risk category statement and \ntolerance thresholds, enterprise-wide \nscreening, annual risk assessments and \naudits of sanctions control processes, \nemployee training and a diverse team \nof Compliance professionals stationed \naround the world.  \n\nAnti-Money Laundering \nProgram\n\nCiti\u2019s AML Program works to protect \nour clients, our franchise and the global \nfinancial system from the risks of money \nlaundering and terrorist financing. \n\nThe program centers on: \n\n \u2022 Prevention: Citi\u2019s Global Know Your \n\nCustomer Program is the cornerstone \nof our AML Program, enabling us \nto effectively evaluate the potential \nrisks associated with each client \nrelationship and ensure that we \nadhere to globally consistent policies \nand standards, customer risk scoring \nand onboarding. \n\nCiti 2019 ESG Report\f##PAGE_BREAK## \u2022 Detection: We monitor transactions \n\nto identify unusual or suspicious \ntransactions, behaviors or patterns \nof activity across our global footprint. \nOur AML investigations unit reviews \ntransactions of new and existing cli-\nents across businesses and regions.  \n\nrequirements at both the global and local \nlevels.

In 2019, Citi Korea earned this \nprestigious honor at the 12th annual AML \nDay commemoration. Citi was recognized \nfor establishing a dedicated AML moni-\ntoring team and introducing a risk-based \napproach to maintain high standards in \nregulatory reporting. \n\n \u2022 Reporting: We create, track and \nfile Suspicious Activity Reports, \nSuspicious Transaction Reports and \nCurrency Transaction Reports, as \nrequired in many countries.  \n\n \u2022 Governance: Our enterprise-wide \n\ncontrols that govern the overall \nprogram include global AML policies, \nprocesses, testing and training. Citi\u2019s \nGlobal AML Program Head and Bank \nSecrecy Act Officer is responsible for \noverseeing the program, including \napprising the Board of Directors and \nsenior management of AML initia-\ntives, any significant deficiencies and \nthe reporting of suspicious activity. \n\nOur AML Program includes more than \n5,700 employees globally, including \nmore than 490 designated AML Officers \ncovering every Citi business, function \nand geographic area. These specialists \npartner with various functions, including \nCompliance, Audit, Technology, and our \ninstitutional and consumer businesses, \nto provide effective enterprise AML risk \nassessment and to meet our AML-related \n\nCombating the Illegal \nWildlife Trade\n\nFinancial institutions play a critical \nrole in disrupting the flow of income \ngenerated by illegal wildlife traffick-\ning (IWT). Citi is a member of United \nfor Wildlife\u2019s Financial Taskforce, \na collaboration between financial \ninstitutions and NGOs to fight IWT, \nwhich is a multibillion-dollar global \ncriminal enterprise. Throughout \n2019, we issued a series of internal \npublications focused on IWT \u2014 \nespecially regarding elephants, \nrhinos and pangolins \u2014 to increase \nawareness, identify red flags and \nenhance our AML program at \nmultiple touchpoints, including \nclient onboarding, transactional \nreview and investigations. We also \nshared these red flags with relevant \nclients to help them identify IWT. \nIn addition, Citi worked closely with \nThe Royal Foundation and other \nfinancial institutions to develop a \nlong-term strategic plan to mobilize \nthe Financial Taskforce and develop \ngoals for 2020 and beyond. \n\n120\n\n\f##PAGE_BREAK##Contents \n\n  Our Approach to ESG \n\n  Solutions for Impact \n\n  How We Do Business \n\n  Appendices             \n\nNumber of Employees Who Completed Citi\u2019s 2019 Anti-Money \nLaundering, Sanctions and Anti-Bribery Training (By Region)* \n\n62,778\n\nNorth  \nAmerica\n\n26,225\n\nEurope, Middle \nEast and Africa\n\n41,924\n\nLatin  \nAmerica\n\n57,956\n\nAsia  \nPacific\n\n188,883\n\nTotal  \n\nEmployees\n\n*  This combined online training incorporates multiple anti-corruption efforts, including AML, sanctions and anti- \n\nbribery training. Numbers include all Citi staff who completed the 2019 training as of February 2020.  \n(Employees and nonemployee workers have 30 days to complete it.) \n\nImproving the Client Experience for Embassy Banking\n\nIn 2005, one of the largest banks in Washington, D.C., was forced to pay more than \n$40 million in criminal and civil fines for its failure to detect high-profile money  \nlaundering and possible terrorist financing via its embassy accounts for the countries \nof Saudi Arabia, Equatorial Guinea and Chile. The episode sent a clear message that \nbanks working with embassies had to get serious about implementing strong anti-\nmoney laundering controls. \n\nTraditionally, embassies have executed \npayments independently and with limited \noversight from a central governing body, \nallowing embassy officials to make indi-\nvidual transaction decisions. This oper-\nating model leads to banks establishing \nnumerous relationships with separate \nentities around the world, making it more \nchallenging to Know Your Customer (KYC), \na regulatory requirement that mandates \nthat banks understand their clients, obtain \ndetailed information about them and their \nintended activity, and ensure that services \nare not being used for illegal activities. \n\nCiti developed an approach allowing \nembassy clients to utilize existing central-\nized cash management platforms to \nexecute payments that enhanced oversight \nand transparency by their home govern-\nments, rather than operating independently \nor extensively with cash at the local level. \nImplementing these tools mitigates the \nrisk posed by our embassy clients, reduces \nthe administrative burden on KYC owners \naround KYC periodic reviews and improves \nthe overall client experience. \n\nFor our clients, the new approach meant \ngreater transparency and reduced operat-\ning costs. Australia, for example, previously \nbought currency locally and sent it to its \nforeign embassies to manage. After the \nimplementation of new tools from Citi, the \nAustralian Department of Foreign Affairs \nand Trade gained the ability to see every \none of its bank accounts and payments \naround the world, aggregated on a single \nplatform. \n\n121\n\nCiti 2019 ESG Report\f##PAGE_BREAK##Serving Our \nCustomers and  \nClients Responsibly\n\nWe have policies and systems in place to \nmake sure we are always treating custom-\ners responsibly and fairly, as reflected \nin our Code of Conduct and our internal \nchecks-and-balances processes when \ncreating new products.\n\nResponsible Marketing \n\nWe are committed to providing clients \nwith the right products and services \nbased on their needs, wants and pref-\nerences, while adhering to all internal \npolicies and procedures as well as all \nbanking laws and regulations. We take the \ntime to understand the unique financial \nrequirements of each client and offer \nonly products and services that meet \nthose needs. We work diligently to clearly \ndisclose all of the features and terms and \nconditions, including applicable fees and \ncharges, for the products and services \noffered so that clients can select and  \nuse the product or service best suited  \nto them. \n\nAs part of our customer-centric approach \nto communicating in a simple, straight-\nforward manner, our Global Consumer \nBanking Branded Cards business \ncontinues to deliver personalized videos \nto heighten customer comprehension \nof key topics.

For new \ncardmembers, we updated our personal-\nized welcome videos to encourage digital \nadoption and ensure that users have \na clear understanding of features. For \nexample, a personalized digital checklist \nwas added to help users understand their \ndigital self-service tools. \n\n \nWe deliver innovative, powerful solutions \nfor our customers to drive greater \nsimplicity, convenience, control and \ninsight. Digital and mobile are at the core \nof a simpler, better client and customer \nexperience, and our ongoing enhance-\nments to our mobile app helped us to \nachieve certification in 2019 from J.D. \nPower. Learn more about how we work \nto improve the digital experience of our \nclients in the Digital Innovation section. \n\nWe also provide our customers with \ntimely resources and information related \nto safety and security. Our U.S. online \nSecurity Center enables customers to \nlearn about what Citi does to protect \nthem and what they can do to protect \nthemselves against identify theft and \nother security risks.  \n\nFurther, in an effort to contribute to \neliminating gender bias in marketing, Citi \nis part of #SeeHer, a groundbreaking \nmovement launched by the Association of \nNational Advertisers (ANA) to eliminate \nunconscious bias against women and girls \nin advertising and media. Through this \npartnership, we\u2019re collaborating with the \nANA to increase the accurate portrayal of \nwomen and girls in media by 20 percent  \nby 2020 and leverage our scale to influ-\nence positive change. Through a related \ncampaign, #SeeHerHearHer, we are \nusing our influence to enable progress \nfor gender equality in the music industry. \nMusic plays a significant role in our \ntelevision brand campaigns, and we now \nrequire the inclusion of female artists as \npart of the music search criteria for all TV \nspots.\n\nThese initiatives are just some examples \nof our firm-wide commitment to ensuring \nthat our activities are in the best \ninterests of our clients. More broadly, \nnew products are approved by cross-\nfunctional committees that include \nsenior executives from Risk, Legal, ICRM \nand other relevant units, supported by \nspecialists from Fair Lending, as needed. \nCiti marketing materials are reviewed by \nour Compliance and Legal departments \nto ensure that we communicate clearly  \n\n \nand fairly and comply with applicable \nlaws, regulations and Citi policies. These \nteams also provide periodic testing \nor monitoring of such materials and \ndisclosures. Each relevant business \nmaintains a complaints management \nprogram to receive and respond to \nconsumer concerns. \n\nTreating Customers Fairly\n\nThrough Citi\u2019s commitment to Treating \nCustomers Fairly (TCF) and our Global \nConsumer Fairness Policy, we strive to \nearn and maintain the public\u2019s trust by \nconstantly adhering to the highest ethical \nstandards in conducting our business.

The policy covers all \naspects of the consumer product and \nservices lifecycle, including new product \ndevelopment, marketing, sales (includ-\ning variable incentive compensation), \nunderwriting and onboarding as well as \nall other stages. There are established, \nformalized escalation processes to \nBusiness Practices Committees that \nfacilitate consistent, timely and appropri-\nate identification, analysis and escalation \nof potential consumer fairness and \nreputational and franchise risk issues. In \nrelation to designing variable incentive \nplans, we consider a number of factors, \nincluding whether plans align with our \nTCF principles. For example, we leverage \nclient satisfaction metrics, where avail-\nable, along with other product-based \nmetrics, to incentivize achieving business \nresults that adhere to internal policies \nand our Code of Conduct. We routinely \nevaluate incentive plans, training content, \ncontrols, monitoring and oversight in \norder to maintain a sales force that \ndelivers on Citi\u2019s commitment to serving \nour customers with fairness, value, clarity \nand dependability.  \n\nAs part of the program, Global Consumer \nBanking employees are required to \ncomplete annual TCF training to ensure \nthey understand how to identify issues \nof fairness and how fairness influences \nreal-world results. In 2019, more than \n90,000 Citi employees around the world \ncompleted the course. We also have a \nrange of measures in place to monitor \nsales practices, including auditing, \nmystery shopping and suitability metrics \nthat assess client risk profiles against \nthe risk profile of the investment. When \nappropriate, we proactively contact \ndelinquent clients, basing the time and \nfrequency on their credit risk profile \nand previous payment performance. We \nensure that all contact strategies are \neffectively vetted for privacy and fairness \nconsiderations before implementation.\n\nIn the U.S., fair lending practices are a \nkey component of our commitment to \ntreating customers fairly. Our U.S. Fair \nLending Policy establishes the guiding \nprinciples and minimum standards for \nfair, equitable and nondiscriminatory \naccess to credit. Further, it prohibits \n\ndiscrimination against actual or prospec-\ntive clients on the basis of race, sex \n(which encompasses gender as well as \nsexual orientation and gender identity), \nreligion, disability or other prohibited \nfactors. This commitment is backed \nby training, processes, controls and \noversight to prevent discrimination and \nminimize disparate impact. \n\nTrue to our commitment to responsible \nfinance, we also hold an annual Fair and \nInclusive Banking Offsite with senior \nmanagement from across the company \nto deepen their understanding of fair \nlending and accessibility. Building \non efforts at the 2018 offsite, during \nwhich our CEO challenged participants \nto outsmart their unconscious biases, \nparticipants in 2019 learned from leading \ninternal and external experts how to \nembed inclusion and protection from \ndiscrimination into current strategic \npriorities.  \n\nAs the external environment and our \nbusiness strategies continue to evolve, \nwe work to continue to update our \n\n123\n\nCiti 2019 ESG Report\f##PAGE_BREAK##we disclose our U.S. political contri-\nbutions on our Corporate Governance \nwebpage.
